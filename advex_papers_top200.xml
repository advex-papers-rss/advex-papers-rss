      <title>AdvRush: Searching for Adversarially Robust Neural Architectures. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01289</link>
      <description>  Deep neural networks continue to awe the world with their remarkable performance. Their predictions, however, are prone to be corrupted by adversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans. Current efforts to improve the robustness of neural networks against adversarial examples are focused on developing robust training methods, which update the weights of a neural network in a more robust direction. In this work, we take a step beyond training of the weight parameters and consider the problem of designing an adversarially robust neural architecture with high intrinsic robustness. We propose AdvRush, a novel adversarial robustness-aware neural architecture search algorithm, based upon a finding that independent of the training method, the intrinsic robustness of a neural network can be represented with the smoothness of its input loss landscape. Through a regularizer that favors a candidate architecture with a smoother input loss landscape, AdvRush successfully discovers an adversarially robust neural architecture. Along with a comprehensive theoretical motivation for AdvRush, we conduct an extensive amount of experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of AdvRush on various benchmark datasets. Notably, on CIFAR-10, AdvRush achieves 55.91% robust accuracy under FGSM attack after standard training and 50.04% robust accuracy under AutoAttack after 7-step PGD adversarial training. </description>

      <title>The Devil is in the GAN: Defending Deep Generative Models Against Backdoor Attacks. (88%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01644</link>
      <description>  Deep Generative Models (DGMs) allow users to synthesize data from complex, high-dimensional manifolds. Industry applications of DGMs include data augmentation to boost performance of (semi-)supervised machine learning, or to mitigate fairness or privacy concerns. Large-scale DGMs are notoriously hard to train, requiring expert skills, large amounts of data and extensive computational resources. Thus, it can be expected that many enterprises will resort to sourcing pre-trained DGMs from potentially unverified third parties, e.g.~open source model repositories.   As we show in this paper, such a deployment scenario poses a new attack surface, which allows adversaries to potentially undermine the integrity of entire machine learning development pipelines in a victim organization. Specifically, we describe novel training-time attacks resulting in corrupted DGMs that synthesize regular data under normal operations and designated target outputs for inputs sampled from a trigger distribution. Depending on the control that the adversary has over the random number generation, this imposes various degrees of risk that harmful data may enter the machine learning development pipelines, potentially causing material or reputational damage to the victim organization.   Our attacks are based on adversarial loss functions that combine the dual objectives of attack stealth and fidelity. We show its effectiveness for a variety of DGM architectures (Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)) and data domains (images, audio). Our experiments show that - even for large-scale industry-grade DGMs - our attack can be mounted with only modest computational efforts. We also investigate the effectiveness of different defensive approaches (based on static/dynamic model and output inspections) and prescribe a practical defense strategy that paves the way for safe usage of DGMs. </description>

      <title>DeepFreeze: Cold Boot Attacks and High Fidelity Model Recovery on Commercial EdgeML Device. (69%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01281</link>
      <description>  EdgeML accelerators like Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS) can enable efficient edge-based inference with complex pre-trained models. The models are loaded in the host (like Raspberry Pi) and then transferred to NCS for inference. In this paper, we demonstrate practical and low-cost cold boot based model recovery attacks on NCS to recover the model architecture and weights, loaded from the Raspberry Pi. The architecture is recovered with 100% success and weights with an error rate of 0.04%. The recovered model reports maximum accuracy loss of 0.5% as compared to original model and allows high fidelity transfer of adversarial examples. We further extend our study to other cold boot attack setups reported in the literature with higher error rates leading to accuracy loss as high as 70%. We then propose a methodology based on knowledge distillation to correct the erroneous weights in recovered model, even without access to original training data. The proposed attack remains unaffected by the model encryption features of the OpenVINO and NCS framework. </description>

      <title>Hybrid Classical-Quantum Deep Learning Models for Autonomous Vehicle Traffic Image Classification Under Adversarial Attack. (98%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01125</link>
      <description>  Image classification must work for autonomous vehicles (AV) operating on public roads, and actions performed based on image misclassification can have serious consequences. Traffic sign images can be misclassified by an adversarial attack on machine learning models used by AVs for traffic sign recognition. To make classification models resilient against adversarial attacks, we used a hybrid deep-learning model with both the quantum and classical layers. Our goal is to study the hybrid deep-learning architecture for classical-quantum transfer learning models to support the current era of intermediate-scale quantum technology. We have evaluated the impacts of various white box adversarial attacks on these hybrid models. The classical part of hybrid models includes a convolution network from the pre-trained Resnet18 model, which extracts informative features from a high dimensional LISA traffic sign image dataset. The output from the classical processor is processed further through the quantum layer, which is composed of various quantum gates and provides support to various quantum mechanical features like entanglement and superposition. We have tested multiple combinations of quantum circuits to provide better classification accuracy with decreasing training data and found better resiliency for our hybrid classical-quantum deep learning model during attacks compared to the classical-only machine learning models. </description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks Against Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework in Internet of Vehicles. (10%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00833</link>
      <description>  Machine learning (ML) has made incredible impacts and transformations in a wide range of vehicular applications. As the use of ML in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) continues to advance, adversarial threats and their impact have become an important subject of research worth exploring. In this paper, we focus on Sybil-based adversarial threats against a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-assisted IoV framework and more specifically, DRL-based dynamic service placement in IoV. We carry out an experimental study with real vehicle trajectories to analyze the impact on service delay and resource congestion under different attack scenarios for the DRL-based dynamic service placement application. We further investigate the impact of the proportion of Sybil-attacked vehicles in the network. The results demonstrate that the performance is significantly affected by Sybil-based data poisoning attacks when compared to adversary-free healthy network scenario. </description>

      <title>Information Stealing in Federated Learning Systems Based on Generative Adversarial Networks. (9%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00701</link>
      <description>  An attack on deep learning systems where intelligent machines collaborate to solve problems could cause a node in the network to make a mistake on a critical judgment. At the same time, the security and privacy concerns of AI have galvanized the attention of experts from multiple disciplines. In this research, we successfully mounted adversarial attacks on a federated learning (FL) environment using three different datasets. The attacks leveraged generative adversarial networks (GANs) to affect the learning process and strive to reconstruct the private data of users by learning hidden features from shared local model parameters. The attack was target-oriented drawing data with distinct class distribution from the CIFAR- 10, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST respectively. Moreover, by measuring the Euclidean distance between the real data and the reconstructed adversarial samples, we evaluated the performance of the adversary in the learning processes in various scenarios. At last, we successfully reconstructed the real data of the victim from the shared global model parameters with all the applied datasets. </description>

      <title>Efficacy of Statistical and Artificial Intelligence-based False Information Cyberattack Detection Models for Connected Vehicles. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01124</link>
      <description>  Connected vehicles (CVs), because of the external connectivity with other CVs and connected infrastructure, are vulnerable to cyberattacks that can instantly compromise the safety of the vehicle itself and other connected vehicles and roadway infrastructure. One such cyberattack is the false information attack, where an external attacker injects inaccurate information into the connected vehicles and eventually can cause catastrophic consequences by compromising safety-critical applications like the forward collision warning. The occurrence and target of such attack events can be very dynamic, making real-time and near-real-time detection challenging. Change point models, can be used for real-time anomaly detection caused by the false information attack. In this paper, we have evaluated three change point-based statistical models; Expectation Maximization, Cumulative Summation, and Bayesian Online Change Point Algorithms for cyberattack detection in the CV data. Also, data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models, which can be used to detect known and unknown underlying patterns in the dataset, have the potential of detecting a real-time anomaly in the CV data. We have used six AI models to detect false information attacks and compared the performance for detecting the attacks with our developed change point models. Our study shows that change points models performed better in real-time false information attack detection compared to the performance of the AI models. Change point models having the advantage of no training requirements can be a feasible and computationally efficient alternative to AI models for false information attack detection in connected vehicles. </description>

      <title>Threat of Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning in Computer Vision: Survey II. (92%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00401</link>
      <description>  Deep Learning (DL) is the most widely used tool in the contemporary field of computer vision. Its ability to accurately solve complex problems is employed in vision research to learn deep neural models for a variety of tasks, including security critical applications. However, it is now known that DL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can manipulate its predictions by introducing visually imperceptible perturbations in images and videos. Since the discovery of this phenomenon in 2013~[1], it has attracted significant attention of researchers from multiple sub-fields of machine intelligence. In [2], we reviewed the contributions made by the computer vision community in adversarial attacks on deep learning (and their defenses) until the advent of year 2018. Many of those contributions have inspired new directions in this area, which has matured significantly since witnessing the first generation methods. Hence, as a legacy sequel of [2], this literature review focuses on the advances in this area since 2018. To ensure authenticity, we mainly consider peer-reviewed contributions published in the prestigious sources of computer vision and machine learning research. Besides a comprehensive literature review, the article also provides concise definitions of technical terminologies for non-experts in this domain. Finally, this article discusses challenges and future outlook of this direction based on the literature reviewed herein and [2]. </description>

      <title>Certified Defense via Latent Space Randomized Smoothing with Orthogonal Encoders. (80%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00491</link>
      <description>  Randomized Smoothing (RS), being one of few provable defenses, has been showing great effectiveness and scalability in terms of defending against $\ell_2$-norm adversarial perturbations. However, the cost of MC sampling needed in RS for evaluation is high and computationally expensive. To address this issue, we investigate the possibility of performing randomized smoothing and establishing the robust certification in the latent space of a network, so that the overall dimensionality of tensors involved in computation could be drastically reduced. To this end, we propose Latent Space Randomized Smoothing. Another important aspect is that we use orthogonal modules, whose Lipschitz property is known for free by design, to propagate the certified radius estimated in the latent space back to the input space, providing valid certifiable regions for the test samples in the input space. Experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that our method achieves competitive certified robustness but with a significant improvement of efficiency during the test phase. </description>

      <title>An Effective and Robust Detector for Logo Detection. (70%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00422</link>
      <description>  In recent years, intellectual property (IP), which represents literary, inventions, artistic works, etc, gradually attract more and more people's attention. Particularly, with the rise of e-commerce, the IP not only represents the product design and brands, but also represents the images/videos displayed on e-commerce platforms. Unfortunately, some attackers adopt some adversarial methods to fool the well-trained logo detection model for infringement. To overcome this problem, a novel logo detector based on the mechanism of looking and thinking twice is proposed in this paper for robust logo detection. The proposed detector is different from other mainstream detectors, which can effectively detect small objects, long-tail objects, and is robust to adversarial images. In detail, we extend detectoRS algorithm to a cascade schema with an equalization loss function, multi-scale transformations, and adversarial data augmentation. A series of experimental results have shown that the proposed method can effectively improve the robustness of the detection model. Moreover, we have applied the proposed methods to competition ACM MM2021 Robust Logo Detection that is organized by Alibaba on the Tianchi platform and won top 2 in 36489 teams.

      <title>Style Curriculum Learning for Robust Medical Image Segmentation. (2%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00402</link>
      <description>  The performance of deep segmentation models often degrades due to distribution shifts in image intensities between the training and test data sets. This is particularly pronounced in multi-centre studies involving data acquired using multi-vendor scanners, with variations in acquisition protocols. It is challenging to address this degradation because the shift is often not known \textit{a priori} and hence difficult to model. We propose a novel framework to ensure robust segmentation in the presence of such distribution shifts. Our contribution is three-fold. First, inspired by the spirit of curriculum learning, we design a novel style curriculum to train the segmentation models using an easy-to-hard mode. A style transfer model with style fusion is employed to generate the curriculum samples. Gradually focusing on complex and adversarial style samples can significantly boost the robustness of the models. Second, instead of subjectively defining the curriculum complexity, we adopt an automated gradient manipulation method to control the hard and adversarial sample generation process. Third, we propose the Local Gradient Sign strategy to aggregate the gradient locally and stabilise training during gradient manipulation. The proposed framework can generalise to unknown distribution without using any target data. Extensive experiments on the public M\&amp;Ms Challenge dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework can generalise deep models well to unknown distributions and achieve significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. </description>

      <title>Delving into Deep Image Prior for Adversarial Defense: A Novel Reconstruction-based Defense Framework. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00180</link>
      <description>  Deep learning based image classification models are shown vulnerable to adversarial attacks by injecting deliberately crafted noises to clean images. To defend against adversarial attacks in a training-free and attack-agnostic manner, this work proposes a novel and effective reconstruction-based defense framework by delving into deep image prior (DIP). Fundamentally different from existing reconstruction-based defenses, the proposed method analyzes and explicitly incorporates the model decision process into our defense. Given an adversarial image, firstly we map its reconstructed images during DIP optimization to the model decision space, where cross-boundary images can be detected and on-boundary images can be further localized. Then, adversarial noise is purified by perturbing on-boundary images along the reverse direction to the adversarial image. Finally, on-manifold images are stitched to construct an image that can be correctly predicted by the victim classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods both in defending white-box attacks and defense-aware attacks. Moreover, the proposed method can maintain a high visual quality during adversarial image reconstruction. </description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness of Deep Code Comment Generation. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00213</link>
      <description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable performance in a variety of domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, or natural language processing. Recently they also have been applied to various software engineering tasks, typically involving processing source code. DNNs are well-known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., fabricated inputs that could lead to various misbehaviors of the DNN model while being perceived as benign by humans. In this paper, we focus on the code comment generation task in software engineering and study the robustness issue of the DNNs when they are applied to this task. We propose ACCENT, an identifier substitution approach to craft adversarial code snippets, which are syntactically correct and functionality-preserving with respect to the original code snippet, but may mislead the DNNs to produce completely irrelevant code comments. In order to improve the robustness, ACCENT also incorporates a novel training method, which can be applied to existing code comment generation models. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate our approach by attacking the mainstream encoder-decoder architectures on two large-scale publicly available datasets. The results show that ACCENT efficiently produces stable attacks with functionality-preserving adversarial examples, and the generated examples have better transferability compared with baselines. We also confirm, via experiments, the effectiveness in improving model robustness with our training method. </description>

      <title>Towards Adversarially Robust and Domain Generalizable Stereo Matching by Rethinking DNN Feature Backbones. (93%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00335</link>
      <description>  Stereo matching has recently witnessed remarkable progress using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). But, how robust are they? Although it has been well-known that DNNs often suffer from adversarial vulnerability with a catastrophic drop in performance, the situation is even worse in stereo matching. This paper first shows that a type of weak white-box attacks can fail state-of-the-art methods. The attack is learned by a proposed stereo-constrained projected gradient descent (PGD) method in stereo matching. This observation raises serious concerns for the deployment of DNN-based stereo matching. Parallel to the adversarial vulnerability, DNN-based stereo matching is typically trained under the so-called simulation to reality pipeline, and thus domain generalizability is an important problem. This paper proposes to rethink the learnable DNN-based feature backbone towards adversarially-robust and domain generalizable stereo matching, either by completely removing it or by applying it only to the left reference image. It computes the matching cost volume using the classic multi-scale census transform (i.e., local binary pattern) of the raw input stereo images, followed by a stacked Hourglass head sub-network solving the matching problem. In experiments, the proposed method is tested in the SceneFlow dataset and the KITTI2015 benchmark. It significantly improves the adversarial robustness, while retaining accuracy performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. It also shows better generalizability from simulation (SceneFlow) to real (KITTI) datasets when no fine-tuning is used. </description>

      <title>T$_k$ML-AP: Adversarial Attacks to Top-$k$ Multi-Label Learning. (81%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00146</link>
      <description>  Top-$k$ multi-label learning, which returns the top-$k$ predicted labels from an input, has many practical applications such as image annotation, document analysis, and web search engine. However, the vulnerabilities of such algorithms with regards to dedicated adversarial perturbation attacks have not been extensively studied previously. In this work, we develop methods to create adversarial perturbations that can be used to attack top-$k$ multi-label learning-based image annotation systems (TkML-AP). Our methods explicitly consider the top-$k$ ranking relation and are based on novel loss functions. Experimental evaluations on large-scale benchmark datasets including PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in reducing the performance of state-of-the-art top-$k$ multi-label learning methods, under both untargeted and targeted attacks. </description>

      <title>BadEncoder: Backdoor Attacks to Pre-trained Encoders in Self-Supervised Learning. (67%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00352</link>
      <description>  Self-supervised learning in computer vision aims to pre-train an image encoder using a large amount of unlabeled images or (image, text) pairs. The pre-trained image encoder can then be used as a feature extractor to build downstream classifiers for many downstream tasks with a small amount of or no labeled training data. In this work, we propose BadEncoder, the first backdoor attack to self-supervised learning. In particular, our BadEncoder injects backdoors into a pre-trained image encoder such that the downstream classifiers built based on the backdoored image encoder for different downstream tasks simultaneously inherit the backdoor behavior. We formulate our BadEncoder as an optimization problem and we propose a gradient descent based method to solve it, which produces a backdoored image encoder from a clean one. Our extensive empirical evaluation results on multiple datasets show that our BadEncoder achieves high attack success rates while preserving the accuracy of the downstream classifiers. We also show the effectiveness of BadEncoder using two publicly available, real-world image encoders, i.e., Google's image encoder pre-trained on ImageNet and OpenAI's Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) image encoder pre-trained on 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the Internet. Moreover, we consider defenses including Neural Cleanse and MNTD (empirical defenses) as well as PatchGuard (a provable defense). Our results show that these defenses are insufficient to defend against BadEncoder, highlighting the needs for new defenses against our BadEncoder. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/jjy1994/BadEncoder. </description>

      <title>Fair Representation Learning using Interpolation Enabled Disentanglement. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00295</link>
      <description>  With the growing interest in the machine learning community to solve real-world problems, it has become crucial to uncover the hidden reasoning behind their decisions by focusing on the fairness and auditing the predictions made by these black-box models. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address two key issues: (a) Can we simultaneously learn fair disentangled representations while ensuring the utility of the learned representation for downstream tasks, and (b)Can we provide theoretical insights into when the proposed approach will be both fair and accurate. To address the former, we propose the method FRIED, Fair Representation learning using Interpolation Enabled Disentanglement. In our architecture, by imposing a critic-based adversarial framework, we enforce the interpolated points in the latent space to be more realistic. This helps in capturing the data manifold effectively and enhances the utility of the learned representation for downstream prediction tasks. We address the latter question by developing a theory on fairness-accuracy trade-offs using classifier-based conditional mutual information estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FRIED on datasets of different modalities - tabular, text, and image datasets. We observe that the representations learned by FRIED are overall fairer in comparison to existing baselines and also accurate for downstream prediction tasks. Additionally, we evaluate FRIED on a real-world healthcare claims dataset where we conduct an expert aided model auditing study providing useful insights into opioid ad-diction patterns. </description>

      <title>Who's Afraid of Thomas Bayes? (92%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14601</link>
      <description>  In many cases, neural networks perform well on test data, but tend to overestimate their confidence on out-of-distribution data. This has led to adoption of Bayesian neural networks, which better capture uncertainty and therefore more accurately reflect the model's confidence. For machine learning security researchers, this raises the natural question of how making a model Bayesian affects the security of the model. In this work, we explore the interplay between Bayesianism and two measures of security: model privacy and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that Bayesian neural networks are more vulnerable to membership inference attacks in general, but are at least as robust as their non-Bayesian counterparts to adversarial examples. </description>

      <title>Practical Attacks on Voice Spoofing Countermeasures. (86%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14642</link>
      <description>  Voice authentication has become an integral part in security-critical operations, such as bank transactions and call center conversations. The vulnerability of automatic speaker verification systems (ASVs) to spoofing attacks instigated the development of countermeasures (CMs), whose task is to tell apart bonafide and spoofed speech. Together, ASVs and CMs form today's voice authentication platforms, advertised as an impregnable access control mechanism. We develop the first practical attack on CMs, and show how a malicious actor may efficiently craft audio samples to bypass voice authentication in its strictest form. Previous works have primarily focused on non-proactive attacks or adversarial strategies against ASVs that do not produce speech in the victim's voice. The repercussions of our attacks are far more severe, as the samples we generate sound like the victim, eliminating any chance of plausible deniability. Moreover, the few existing adversarial attacks against CMs mistakenly optimize spoofed speech in the feature space and do not take into account the existence of ASVs, resulting in inferior synthetic audio that fails in realistic settings. We eliminate these obstacles through our key technical contribution: a novel joint loss function that enables mounting advanced adversarial attacks against combined ASV/CM deployments directly in the time domain. Our adversarials achieve concerning black-box success rates against state-of-the-art authentication platforms (up to 93.57\%). Finally, we perform the first targeted, over-telephony-network attack on CMs, bypassing several challenges and enabling various potential threats, given the increased use of voice biometrics in call centers. Our results call into question the security of modern voice authentication systems in light of the real threat of attackers bypassing these measures to gain access to users' most valuable resources. </description>

      <title>Can You Hear It? Backdoor Attacks via Ultrasonic Triggers. (22%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14569</link>
      <description>  Deep neural networks represent a powerful option for many real-world applications due to their ability to model even complex data relations. However, such neural networks can also be prohibitively expensive to train, making it common to either outsource the training process to third parties or use pretrained neural networks. Unfortunately, such practices make neural networks vulnerable to various attacks, where one attack is the backdoor attack. In such an attack, the third party training the model may maliciously inject hidden behaviors into the model. Still, if a particular input (called trigger) is fed into a neural network, the network will respond with a wrong result.   In this work, we explore the option of backdoor attacks to automatic speech recognition systems where we inject inaudible triggers. By doing so, we make the backdoor attack challenging to detect for legitimate users, and thus, potentially more dangerous. We conduct experiments on two versions of datasets and three neural networks and explore the performance of our attack concerning the duration, position, and type of the trigger. Our results indicate that less than 1% of poisoned data is sufficient to deploy a backdoor attack and reach a 100% attack success rate. What is more, while the trigger is inaudible, making it without limitations with respect to the duration of the signal, we observed that even short, non-continuous triggers result in highly successful attacks. </description>

      <title>Unveiling the potential of Graph Neural Networks for robust Intrusion Detection. (13%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14756</link>
      <description>  The last few years have seen an increasing wave of attacks with serious economic and privacy damages, which evinces the need for accurate Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Recent works propose the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for building such systems (e.g., decision trees, neural networks). However, existing ML-based NIDS are barely robust to common adversarial attacks, which limits their applicability to real networks. A fundamental problem of these solutions is that they treat and classify flows independently. In contrast, in this paper we argue the importance of focusing on the structural patterns of attacks, by capturing not only the individual flow features, but also the relations between different flows (e.g., the source/destination hosts they share). To this end, we use a graph representation that keeps flow records and their relationships, and propose a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model tailored to process and learn from such graph-structured information. In our evaluation, we first show that the proposed GNN model achieves state-of-the-art results in the well-known CIC-IDS2017 dataset. Moreover, we assess the robustness of our solution under two common adversarial attacks, that intentionally modify the packet size and inter-arrival times to avoid detection. The results show that our model is able to maintain the same level of accuracy as in previous experiments, while state-of-the-art ML techniques degrade up to 50% their accuracy (F1-score) under these attacks. This unprecedented level of robustness is mainly induced by the capability of our GNN model to learn flow patterns of attacks structured as graphs. </description>

      <title>Feature Importance-aware Transferable Adversarial Attacks. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14185</link>
      <description>  Transferability of adversarial examples is of central importance for attacking an unknown model, which facilitates adversarial attacks in more practical scenarios, e.g., blackbox attacks. Existing transferable attacks tend to craft adversarial examples by indiscriminately distorting features to degrade prediction accuracy in a source model without aware of intrinsic features of objects in the images. We argue that such brute-force degradation would introduce model-specific local optimum into adversarial examples, thus limiting the transferability. By contrast, we propose the Feature Importance-aware Attack (FIA), which disrupts important object-aware features that dominate model decisions consistently. More specifically, we obtain feature importance by introducing the aggregate gradient, which averages the gradients with respect to feature maps of the source model, computed on a batch of random transforms of the original clean image. The gradients will be highly correlated to objects of interest, and such correlation presents invariance across different models. Besides, the random transforms will preserve intrinsic features of objects and suppress model-specific information. Finally, the feature importance guides to search for adversarial examples towards disrupting critical features, achieving stronger transferability. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed FIA, i.e., improving the success rate by 8.4% against normally trained models and 11.7% against defense models as compared to the state-of-the-art transferable attacks.

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Robustness via Test-time Transformation Ensembling. (98%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14110</link>
      <description>  Deep learning models are prone to being fooled by imperceptible perturbations known as adversarial attacks. In this work, we study how equipping models with Test-time Transformation Ensembling (TTE) can work as a reliable defense against such attacks. While transforming the input data, both at train and test times, is known to enhance model performance, its effects on adversarial robustness have not been studied. Here, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the impact of TTE, in the form of widely-used image transforms, on adversarial robustness. We show that TTE consistently improves model robustness against a variety of powerful attacks without any need for re-training, and that this improvement comes at virtually no trade-off with accuracy on clean samples. Finally, we show that the benefits of TTE transfer even to the certified robustness domain, in which TTE provides sizable and consistent improvements. </description>

      <title>The Robustness of Graph k-shell Structure under Adversarial Attacks. (93%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13962</link>
      <description>  The k-shell decomposition plays an important role in unveiling the structural properties of a network, i.e., it is widely adopted to find the densest part of a network across a broad range of scientific fields, including Internet, biological networks, social networks, etc. However, there arises concern about the robustness of the k-shell structure when networks suffer from adversarial attacks. Here, we introduce and formalize the problem of the k-shell attack and develop an efficient strategy to attack the k-shell structure by rewiring a small number of links. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to study the robustness of graph k-shell structure under adversarial attacks. In particular, we propose a Simulated Annealing (SA) based k-shell attack method and testify it on four real-world social networks. The extensive experiments validate that the k-shell structure of a network is robust under random perturbation, but it is quite vulnerable under adversarial attack, e.g., in Dolphin and Throne networks, more than 40% nodes change their k-shell values when only 10% links are changed based on our SA-based k-shell attack. Such results suggest that a single structural feature could also be significantly disturbed when only a small fraction of links are changed purposefully in a network. Therefore, it could be an interesting topic to improve the robustness of various network properties against adversarial attack in the future. </description>

      <title>Understanding the Effects of Adversarial Personalized Ranking Optimization Method on Recommendation Quality. (31%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13876</link>
      <description>  Recommender systems (RSs) employ user-item feedback, e.g., ratings, to match customers to personalized lists of products. Approaches to top-k recommendation mainly rely on Learning-To-Rank algorithms and, among them, the most widely adopted is Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which bases on a pair-wise optimization approach. Recently, BPR has been found vulnerable against adversarial perturbations of its model parameters. Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR) mitigates this issue by robustifying BPR via an adversarial training procedure. The empirical improvements of APR's accuracy performance on BPR have led to its wide use in several recommender models. However, a key overlooked aspect has been the beyond-accuracy performance of APR, i.e., novelty, coverage, and amplification of popularity bias, considering that recent results suggest that BPR, the building block of APR, is sensitive to the intensification of biases and reduction of recommendation novelty. In this work, we model the learning characteristics of the BPR and APR optimization frameworks to give mathematical evidence that, when the feedback data have a tailed distribution, APR amplifies the popularity bias more than BPR due to an unbalanced number of received positive updates from short-head items. Using matrix factorization (MF), we empirically validate the theoretical results by performing preliminary experiments on two public datasets to compare BPR-MF and APR-MF performance on accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics. The experimental results consistently show the degradation of novelty and coverage measures and a worrying amplification of bias. </description>

      <title>Towards robust vision by multi-task learning on monkey visual cortex. (3%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14344</link>
      <description>  Deep neural networks set the state-of-the-art across many tasks in computer vision, but their generalization ability to image distortions is surprisingly fragile. In contrast, the mammalian visual system is robust to a wide range of perturbations. Recent work suggests that this generalization ability can be explained by useful inductive biases encoded in the representations of visual stimuli throughout the visual cortex. Here, we successfully leveraged these inductive biases with a multi-task learning approach: we jointly trained a deep network to perform image classification and to predict neural activity in macaque primary visual cortex (V1). We measured the out-of-distribution generalization abilities of our network by testing its robustness to image distortions. We found that co-training on monkey V1 data leads to increased robustness despite the absence of those distortions during training. Additionally, we showed that our network's robustness is very close to that of an Oracle network where parts of the architecture are directly trained on noisy images. Our results also demonstrated that the network's representations become more brain-like as their robustness improves. Using a novel constrained reconstruction analysis, we investigated what makes our brain-regularized network more robust. We found that our co-trained network is more sensitive to content than noise when compared to a Baseline network that we trained for image classification alone. Using DeepGaze-predicted saliency maps for ImageNet images, we found that our monkey co-trained network tends to be more sensitive to salient regions in a scene, reminiscent of existing theories on the role of V1 in the detection of object borders and bottom-up saliency. Overall, our work expands the promising research avenue of transferring inductive biases from the brain, and provides a novel analysis of the effects of our transfer. </description>

      <title>Imbalanced Adversarial Training with Reweighting. (86%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13639</link>
      <description>  Adversarial training has been empirically proven to be one of the most effective and reliable defense methods against adversarial attacks. However, almost all existing studies about adversarial training are focused on balanced datasets, where each class has an equal amount of training examples. Research on adversarial training with imbalanced training datasets is rather limited. As the initial effort to investigate this problem, we reveal the facts that adversarially trained models present two distinguished behaviors from naturally trained models in imbalanced datasets: (1) Compared to natural training, adversarially trained models can suffer much worse performance on under-represented classes, when the training dataset is extremely imbalanced. (2) Traditional reweighting strategies may lose efficacy to deal with the imbalance issue for adversarial training. For example, upweighting the under-represented classes will drastically hurt the model's performance on well-represented classes, and as a result, finding an optimal reweighting value can be tremendously challenging. In this paper, to further understand our observations, we theoretically show that the poor data separability is one key reason causing this strong tension between under-represented and well-represented classes. Motivated by this finding, we propose Separable Reweighted Adversarial Training (SRAT) to facilitate adversarial training under imbalanced scenarios, by learning more separable features for different classes. Extensive experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. </description>

      <title>Towards Robustness Against Natural Language Word Substitutions. (73%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13541</link>
      <description>  Robustness against word substitutions has a well-defined and widely acceptable form, i.e., using semantically similar words as substitutions, and thus it is considered as a fundamental stepping-stone towards broader robustness in natural language processing. Previous defense methods capture word substitutions in vector space by using either $l_2$-ball or hyper-rectangle, which results in perturbation sets that are not inclusive enough or unnecessarily large, and thus impedes mimicry of worst cases for robust training. In this paper, we introduce a novel \textit{Adversarial Sparse Convex Combination} (ASCC) method. We model the word substitution attack space as a convex hull and leverages a regularization term to enforce perturbation towards an actual substitution, thus aligning our modeling better with the discrete textual space. Based on the ASCC method, we further propose ASCC-defense, which leverages ASCC to generate worst-case perturbations and incorporates adversarial training towards robustness. Experiments show that ASCC-defense outperforms the current state-of-the-arts in terms of robustness on two prevailing NLP tasks, \emph{i.e.}, sentiment analysis and natural language inference, concerning several attacks across multiple model architectures. Besides, we also envision a new class of defense towards robustness in NLP, where our robustly trained word vectors can be plugged into a normally trained model and enforce its robustness without applying any other defense techniques. </description>

      <title>Models of Computational Profiles to Study the Likelihood of DNN Metamorphic Test Cases. (67%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13491</link>
      <description>  Neural network test cases are meant to exercise different reasoning paths in an architecture and used to validate the prediction outcomes. In this paper, we introduce &quot;computational profiles&quot; as vectors of neuron activation levels. We investigate the distribution of computational profile likelihood of metamorphic test cases with respect to the likelihood distributions of training, test and error control cases. We estimate the non-parametric probability densities of neuron activation levels for each distinct output class. Probabilities are inferred using training cases only, without any additional knowledge about metamorphic test cases. Experiments are performed by training a network on the MNIST Fashion library of images and comparing prediction likelihoods with those obtained from error control-data and from metamorphic test cases. Experimental results show that the distributions of computational profile likelihood for training and test cases are somehow similar, while the distribution of the random-noise control-data is always remarkably lower than the observed one for the training and testing sets. In contrast, metamorphic test cases show a prediction likelihood that lies in an extended range with respect to training, tests, and random noise. Moreover, the presented approach allows the independent assessment of different training classes and experiments to show that some of the classes are more sensitive to misclassifying metamorphic test cases than other classes. In conclusion, metamorphic test cases represent very aggressive tests for neural network architectures. Furthermore, since metamorphic test cases force a network to misclassify those inputs whose likelihood is similar to that of training cases, they could also be considered as adversarial attacks that evade defenses based on computational profile likelihood evaluation. </description>

      <title>WaveCNet: Wavelet Integrated CNNs to Suppress Aliasing Effect for Noise-Robust Image Classification. (15%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13335</link>
      <description>  Though widely used in image classification, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are prone to noise interruptions, i.e. the CNN output can be drastically changed by small image noise. To improve the noise robustness, we try to integrate CNNs with wavelet by replacing the common down-sampling (max-pooling, strided-convolution, and average pooling) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT). We firstly propose general DWT and inverse DWT (IDWT) layers applicable to various orthogonal and biorthogonal discrete wavelets like Haar, Daubechies, and Cohen, etc., and then design wavelet integrated CNNs (WaveCNets) by integrating DWT into the commonly used CNNs (VGG, ResNets, and DenseNet). During the down-sampling, WaveCNets apply DWT to decompose the feature maps into the low-frequency and high-frequency components. Containing the main information including the basic object structures, the low-frequency component is transmitted into the following layers to generate robust high-level features. The high-frequency components are dropped to remove most of the data noises. The experimental results show that %wavelet accelerates the CNN training, and WaveCNets achieve higher accuracy on ImageNet than various vanilla CNNs. We have also tested the performance of WaveCNets on the noisy version of ImageNet, ImageNet-C and six adversarial attacks, the results suggest that the proposed DWT/IDWT layers could provide better noise-robustness and adversarial robustness. When applying WaveCNets as backbones, the performance of object detectors (i.e., faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) on COCO detection dataset are consistently improved. We believe that suppression of aliasing effect, i.e. separation of low frequency and high frequency information, is the main advantages of our approach. The code of our DWT/IDWT layer and different WaveCNets are available at https://github.com/CVI-SZU/WaveCNet. </description>

      <title>TableGAN-MCA: Evaluating Membership Collisions of GAN-Synthesized Tabular Data Releasing. (2%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13190</link>
      <description>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-synthesized table publishing lets people privately learn insights without access to the private table. However, existing studies on Membership Inference (MI) Attacks show promising results on disclosing membership of training datasets of GAN-synthesized tables. Different from those works focusing on discovering membership of a given data point, in this paper, we propose a novel Membership Collision Attack against GANs (TableGAN-MCA), which allows an adversary given only synthetic entries randomly sampled from a black-box generator to recover partial GAN training data. Namely, a GAN-synthesized table immune to state-of-the-art MI attacks is vulnerable to the TableGAN-MCA. The success of TableGAN-MCA is boosted by an observation that GAN-synthesized tables potentially collide with the training data of the generator.   Our experimental evaluations on TableGAN-MCA have five main findings. First, TableGAN-MCA has a satisfying training data recovery rate on three commonly used real-world datasets against four generative models. Second, factors, including the size of GAN training data, GAN training epochs and the number of synthetic samples available to the adversary, are positively correlated to the success of TableGAN-MCA. Third, highly frequent data points have high risks of being recovered by TableGAN-MCA. Fourth, some unique data are exposed to unexpected high recovery risks in TableGAN-MCA, which may attribute to GAN's generalization. Fifth, as expected, differential privacy, without the consideration of the correlations between features, does not show commendable mitigation effect against the TableGAN-MCA. Finally, we propose two mitigation methods and show promising privacy and utility trade-offs when protecting against TableGAN-MCA. </description>

      <title>Towards Black-box Attacks on Deep Learning Apps. (89%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12732</link>
      <description>  Deep learning is a powerful weapon to boost application performance in many fields, including face recognition, object detection, image classification, natural language understanding, and recommendation system. With the rapid increase in the computing power of mobile devices, developers can embed deep learning models into their apps for building more competitive products with more accurate and faster responses. Although there are several works about adversarial attacks against deep learning models in mobile apps, they all need information about the models' internals (i.e., structures, weights) or need to modify the models. In this paper, we propose an effective black-box approach by training a substitute model to spoof the deep learning system inside the apps. To evaluate our approach, we select 10 real-world deep-learning apps with high popularity from Google Play to perform black-box adversarial attacks. Through the study, we find three factors that can influence the performance of attacks. Our approach can reach a relatively high attack success rate of 66.60% on average. Compared with other adversarial attacks on mobile deep learning models, in terms of the average attack success rates, our approach outperforms counterparts by 27.63%. </description>

      <title>Poisoning of Online Learning Filters: DDoS Attacks and Countermeasures. (50%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12612</link>
      <description>  The recent advancements in machine learning have led to a wave of interest in adopting online learning-based approaches for long-standing attack mitigation issues. In particular, DDoS attacks remain a significant threat to network service availability even after more than two decades. These attacks have been well studied under the assumption that malicious traffic originates from a single attack profile. Based on this premise, malicious traffic characteristics are assumed to be considerably different from legitimate traffic. Consequently, online filtering methods are designed to learn network traffic distributions adaptively and rank requests according to their attack likelihood. During an attack, requests rated as malicious are precipitously dropped by the filters. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on the effects of data poisoning attacks on online DDoS filtering; introduce one such attack method, and propose practical protective countermeasures for these attacks. We investigate an adverse scenario where the attacker is &quot;crafty&quot;, switching profiles during attacks and generating erratic attack traffic that is ever-shifting. This elusive attacker generates malicious requests by manipulating and shifting traffic distribution to poison the training data and corrupt the filters. To this end, we present a generative model MimicShift, capable of controlling traffic generation while retaining the originating regular traffic's intrinsic properties. Comprehensive experiments show that online learning filters are highly susceptible to poisoning attacks, sometimes performing much worse than a random filtering strategy in this attack scenario. At the same time, our proposed protective countermeasure effectively minimizes the attack impact. </description>

      <title>PDF-Malware: An Overview on Threats, Detection and Evasion Attacks. (8%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12873</link>
      <description>  In the recent years, Portable Document Format, commonly known as PDF, has become a democratized standard for document exchange and dissemination. This trend has been due to its characteristics such as its flexibility and portability across platforms. The widespread use of PDF has installed a false impression of inherent safety among benign users. However, the characteristics of PDF motivated hackers to exploit various types of vulnerabilities, overcome security safeguards, thereby making the PDF format one of the most efficient malicious code attack vectors. Therefore, efficiently detecting malicious PDF files is crucial for information security. Several analysis techniques has been proposed in the literature, be it static or dynamic, to extract the main features that allow the discrimination of malware files from benign ones. Since classical analysis techniques may be limited in case of zero-days, machine-learning based techniques have emerged recently as an automatic PDF-malware detection method that is able to generalize from a set of training samples. These techniques are themselves facing the challenge of evasion attacks where a malicious PDF is transformed to look benign. In this work, we give an overview on the PDF-malware detection problem. We give a perspective on the new challenges and emerging solutions. </description>

      <title>Benign Adversarial Attack: Tricking Algorithm for Goodness. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11986</link>
      <description>  In spite of the successful application in many fields, machine learning algorithms today suffer from notorious problems like vulnerability to adversarial examples. Beyond falling into the cat-and-mouse game between adversarial attack and defense, this paper provides alternative perspective to consider adversarial example and explore whether we can exploit it in benign applications. We first propose a novel taxonomy of visual information along task-relevance and semantic-orientation. The emergence of adversarial example is attributed to algorithm's utilization of task-relevant non-semantic information. While largely ignored in classical machine learning mechanisms, task-relevant non-semantic information enjoys three interesting characteristics as (1) exclusive to algorithm, (2) reflecting common weakness, and (3) utilizable as features. Inspired by this, we present brave new idea called benign adversarial attack to exploit adversarial examples for goodness in three directions: (1) adversarial Turing test, (2) rejecting malicious algorithm, and (3) adversarial data augmentation. Each direction is positioned with motivation elaboration, justification analysis and prototype applications to showcase its potential. </description>

      <title>Learning to Adversarially Blur Visual Object Tracking. (98%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12085</link>
      <description>  Motion blur caused by the moving of the object or camera during the exposure can be a key challenge for visual object tracking, affecting tracking accuracy significantly. In this work, we explore the robustness of visual object trackers against motion blur from a new angle, i.e., adversarial blur attack (ABA). Our main objective is to online transfer input frames to their natural motion-blurred counterparts while misleading the state-of-the-art trackers during the tracking process. To this end, we first design the motion blur synthesizing method for visual tracking based on the generation principle of motion blur, considering the motion information and the light accumulation process. With this synthetic method, we propose \textit{optimization-based ABA (OP-ABA)} by iteratively optimizing an adversarial objective function against the tracking w.r.t. the motion and light accumulation parameters. The OP-ABA is able to produce natural adversarial examples but the iteration can cause heavy time cost, making it unsuitable for attacking real-time trackers. To alleviate this issue, we further propose \textit{one-step ABA (OS-ABA)} where we design and train a joint adversarial motion and accumulation predictive network (JAMANet) with the guidance of OP-ABA, which is able to efficiently estimate the adversarial motion and accumulation parameters in a one-step way.

      <title>Adversarial Attacks with Time-Scale Representations. (96%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12473</link>
      <description>  We propose a novel framework for real-time black-box universal attacks which disrupts activations of early convolutional layers in deep learning models. Our hypothesis is that perturbations produced in the wavelet space disrupt early convolutional layers more effectively than perturbations performed in the time domain. The main challenge in adversarial attacks is to preserve low frequency image content while minimally changing the most meaningful high frequency content. To address this, we formulate an optimization problem using time-scale (wavelet) representations as a dual space in three steps. First, we project original images into orthonormal sub-spaces for low and high scales via wavelet coefficients. Second, we perturb wavelet coefficients for high scale projection using a generator network. Third, we generate new adversarial images by projecting back the original coefficients from the low scale and the perturbed coefficients from the high scale sub-space. We provide a theoretical framework that guarantees a dual mapping from time and time-scale domain representations. We compare our results with state-of-the-art black-box attacks from generative-based and gradient-based models. We also verify efficacy against multiple defense methods such as JPEG compression, Guided Denoiser and Comdefend. Our results show that wavelet-based perturbations consistently outperform time-based attacks thus providing new insights into vulnerabilities of deep learning models and could potentially lead to robust architectures or new defense and attack mechanisms by leveraging time-scale representations. </description>

      <title>Adversarial training may be a double-edged sword. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11671</link>
      <description>  Adversarial training has been shown as an effective approach to improve the robustness of image classifiers against white-box attacks. However, its effectiveness against black-box attacks is more nuanced. In this work, we demonstrate that some geometric consequences of adversarial training on the decision boundary of deep networks give an edge to certain types of black-box attacks. In particular, we define a metric called robustness gain to show that while adversarial training is an effective method to dramatically improve the robustness in white-box scenarios, it may not provide such a good robustness gain against the more realistic decision-based black-box attacks. Moreover, we show that even the minimal perturbation white-box attacks can converge faster against adversarially-trained neural networks compared to the regular ones. </description>

      <title>Detecting Adversarial Examples Is (Nearly) As Hard As Classifying Them. (98%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11630</link>
      <description>  Making classifiers robust to adversarial examples is hard. Thus, many defenses tackle the seemingly easier task of detecting perturbed inputs. We show a barrier towards this goal. We prove a general hardness reduction between detection and classification of adversarial examples: given a robust detector for attacks at distance {\epsilon} (in some metric), we can build a similarly robust (but inefficient) classifier for attacks at distance {\epsilon}/2. Our reduction is computationally inefficient, and thus cannot be used to build practical classifiers. Instead, it is a useful sanity check to test whether empirical detection results imply something much stronger than the authors presumably anticipated. To illustrate, we revisit 13 detector defenses. For 11/13 cases, we show that the claimed detection results would imply an inefficient classifier with robustness far beyond the state-of-the-art. </description>

      <title>Stress Test Evaluation of Biomedical Word Embeddings. (73%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11652</link>
      <description>  The success of pretrained word embeddings has motivated their use in the biomedical domain, with contextualized embeddings yielding remarkable results in several biomedical NLP tasks. However, there is a lack of research on quantifying their behavior under severe &quot;stress&quot; scenarios. In this work, we systematically evaluate three language models with adversarial examples -- automatically constructed tests that allow us to examine how robust the models are. We propose two types of stress scenarios focused on the biomedical named entity recognition (NER) task, one inspired by spelling errors and another based on the use of synonyms for medical terms. Our experiments with three benchmarks show that the performance of the original models decreases considerably, in addition to revealing their weaknesses and strengths. Finally, we show that adversarial training causes the models to improve their robustness and even to exceed the original performance in some cases. </description>

      <title>X-GGM: Graph Generative Modeling for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Visual Question Answering. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11576</link>
      <description>  Encouraging progress has been made towards Visual Question Answering (VQA) in recent years, but it is still challenging to enable VQA models to adaptively generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Intuitively, recompositions of existing visual concepts (i.e., attributes and objects) can generate unseen compositions in the training set, which will promote VQA models to generalize to OOD samples. In this paper, we formulate OOD generalization in VQA as a compositional generalization problem and propose a graph generative modeling-based training scheme (X-GGM) to handle the problem implicitly. X-GGM leverages graph generative modeling to iteratively generate a relation matrix and node representations for the predefined graph that utilizes attribute-object pairs as nodes. Furthermore, to alleviate the unstable training issue in graph generative modeling, we propose a gradient distribution consistency loss to constrain the data distribution with adversarial perturbations and the generated distribution. The baseline VQA model (LXMERT) trained with the X-GGM scheme achieves state-of-the-art OOD performance on two standard VQA OOD benchmarks, i.e., VQA-CP v2 and GQA-OOD. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of X-GGM components. </description>

      <title>A Differentiable Language Model Adversarial Attack on Text Classifiers. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11275</link>
      <description>  Robustness of huge Transformer-based models for natural language processing is an important issue due to their capabilities and wide adoption. One way to understand and improve robustness of these models is an exploration of an adversarial attack scenario: check if a small perturbation of an input can fool a model.   Due to the discrete nature of textual data, gradient-based adversarial methods, widely used in computer vision, are not applicable per~se. The standard strategy to overcome this issue is to develop token-level transformations, which do not take the whole sentence into account.   In this paper, we propose a new black-box sentence-level attack. Our method fine-tunes a pre-trained language model to generate adversarial examples. A proposed differentiable loss function depends on a substitute classifier score and an approximate edit distance computed via a deep learning model.   We show that the proposed attack outperforms competitors on a diverse set of NLP problems for both computed metrics and human evaluation. Moreover, due to the usage of the fine-tuned language model, the generated adversarial examples are hard to detect, thus current models are not robust. Hence, it is difficult to defend from the proposed attack, which is not the case for other attacks. </description>

      <title>Structack: Structure-based Adversarial Attacks on Graph Neural Networks. (86%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11327</link>
      <description>  Recent work has shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks on graph data. Common attack approaches are typically informed, i.e. they have access to information about node attributes such as labels and feature vectors. In this work, we study adversarial attacks that are uninformed, where an attacker only has access to the graph structure, but no information about node attributes. Here the attacker aims to exploit structural knowledge and assumptions, which GNN models make about graph data. In particular, literature has shown that structural node centrality and similarity have a strong influence on learning with GNNs. Therefore, we study the impact of centrality and similarity on adversarial attacks on GNNs. We demonstrate that attackers can exploit this information to decrease the performance of GNNs by focusing on injecting links between nodes of low similarity and, surprisingly, low centrality. We show that structure-based uninformed attacks can approach the performance of informed attacks, while being computationally more efficient. With our paper, we present a new attack strategy on GNNs that we refer to as Structack. Structack can successfully manipulate the performance of GNNs with very limited information while operating under tight computational constraints. Our work contributes towards building more robust machine learning approaches on graphs. </description>

      <title>Adversarial Reinforced Instruction Attacker for Robust Vision-Language Navigation. (45%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11252</link>
      <description>  Language instruction plays an essential role in the natural language grounded navigation tasks. However, navigators trained with limited human-annotated instructions may have difficulties in accurately capturing key information from the complicated instruction at different timesteps, leading to poor navigation performance. In this paper, we exploit to train a more robust navigator which is capable of dynamically extracting crucial factors from the long instruction, by using an adversarial attacking paradigm. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Reinforced Instruction Attacker (DR-Attacker), which learns to mislead the navigator to move to the wrong target by destroying the most instructive information in instructions at different timesteps. By formulating the perturbation generation as a Markov Decision Process, DR-Attacker is optimized by the reinforcement learning algorithm to generate perturbed instructions sequentially during the navigation, according to a learnable attack score. Then, the perturbed instructions, which serve as hard samples, are used for improving the robustness of the navigator with an effective adversarial training strategy and an auxiliary self-supervised reasoning task. Experimental results on both Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) and Navigation from Dialog History (NDH) tasks show the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the visualization analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed DR-Attacker, which can successfully attack crucial information in the instructions at different timesteps.

      <title>Free Hyperbolic Neural Networks with Limited Radii. (8%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11472</link>
      <description>  Non-Euclidean geometry with constant negative curvature, i.e., hyperbolic space, has attracted sustained attention in the community of machine learning. Hyperbolic space, owing to its ability to embed hierarchical structures continuously with low distortion, has been applied for learning data with tree-like structures. Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNNs) that operate directly in hyperbolic space have also been proposed recently to further exploit the potential of hyperbolic representations. While HNNs have achieved better performance than Euclidean neural networks (ENNs) on datasets with implicit hierarchical structure, they still perform poorly on standard classification benchmarks such as CIFAR and ImageNet. The traditional wisdom is that it is critical for the data to respect the hyperbolic geometry when applying HNNs. In this paper, we first conduct an empirical study showing that the inferior performance of HNNs on standard recognition datasets can be attributed to the notorious vanishing gradient problem. We further discovered that this problem stems from the hybrid architecture of HNNs. Our analysis leads to a simple yet effective solution called Feature Clipping, which regularizes the hyperbolic embedding whenever its norm exceeding a given threshold. Our thorough experiments show that the proposed method can successfully avoid the vanishing gradient problem when training HNNs with backpropagation. The improved HNNs are able to achieve comparable performance with ENNs on standard image recognition datasets including MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet, while demonstrating more adversarial robustness and stronger out-of-distribution detection capability. </description>

      <title>On the Certified Robustness for Ensemble Models and Beyond. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10873</link>
      <description>  Recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNN) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which aim to mislead DNNs by adding perturbations with small magnitude. To defend against such attacks, both empirical and theoretical defense approaches have been extensively studied for a single ML model. In this work, we aim to analyze and provide the certified robustness for ensemble ML models, together with the sufficient and necessary conditions of robustness for different ensemble protocols. Although ensemble models are shown more robust than a single model empirically; surprisingly, we find that in terms of the certified robustness the standard ensemble models only achieve marginal improvement compared to a single model. Thus, to explore the conditions that guarantee to provide certifiably robust ensemble ML models, we first prove that diversified gradient and large confidence margin are sufficient and necessary conditions for certifiably robust ensemble models under the model-smoothness assumption. We then provide the bounded model-smoothness analysis based on the proposed Ensemble-before-Smoothing strategy. We also prove that an ensemble model can always achieve higher certified robustness than a single base model under mild conditions. Inspired by the theoretical findings, we propose the lightweight Diversity Regularized Training (DRT) to train certifiably robust ensemble ML models. Extensive experiments show that our DRT enhanced ensembles can consistently achieve higher certified robustness than existing single and ensemble ML models, demonstrating the state-of-the-art certified L2-robustness on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets. </description>

      <title>Unsupervised Detection of Adversarial Examples with Model Explanations. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10480</link>
      <description>  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable performance in a diverse range of machine learning applications. However, it is widely known that DNNs are vulnerable to simple adversarial perturbations, which causes the model to incorrectly classify inputs. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to detect adversarial examples, using methods developed to explain the model's behavior. Our key observation is that adding small, humanly imperceptible perturbations can lead to drastic changes in the model explanations, resulting in unusual or irregular forms of explanations. From this insight, we propose an unsupervised detection of adversarial examples using reconstructor networks trained only on model explanations of benign examples. Our evaluations with MNIST handwritten dataset show that our method is capable of detecting adversarial examples generated by the state-of-the-art algorithms with high confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first in suggesting unsupervised defense method using model explanations. </description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attack and Defense for Wireless Signal Classifiers with Deep Learning. (83%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12173</link>
      <description>  An over-the-air membership inference attack (MIA) is presented to leak private information from a wireless signal classifier. Machine learning (ML) provides powerful means to classify wireless signals, e.g., for PHY-layer authentication. As an adversarial machine learning attack, the MIA infers whether a signal of interest has been used in the training data of a target classifier. This private information incorporates waveform, channel, and device characteristics, and if leaked, can be exploited by an adversary to identify vulnerabilities of the underlying ML model (e.g., to infiltrate the PHY-layer authentication). One challenge for the over-the-air MIA is that the received signals and consequently the RF fingerprints at the adversary and the intended receiver differ due to the discrepancy in channel conditions. Therefore, the adversary first builds a surrogate classifier by observing the spectrum and then launches the black-box MIA on this classifier. The MIA results show that the adversary can reliably infer signals (and potentially the radio and channel information) used to build the target classifier. Therefore, a proactive defense is developed against the MIA by building a shadow MIA model and fooling the adversary. This defense can successfully reduce the MIA accuracy and prevent information leakage from the wireless signal classifier. </description>

      <description>  In this paper, we study the adversarial examples existence and adversarial training from the standpoint of convergence and provide evidence that pointwise convergence in ANNs can explain these observations. The main contribution of our proposal is that it relates the objective of the evasion attacks and adversarial training with concepts already defined in learning theory. Also, we extend and unify some of the other proposals in the literature and provide alternative explanations on the observations made in those proposals. Through different experiments, we demonstrate that the framework is valuable in the study of the phenomenon and is applicable to real-world problems. </description>

      <title>Estimating Predictive Uncertainty Under Program Data Distribution Shift. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10989</link>
      <description>  Deep learning (DL) techniques have achieved great success in predictive accuracy in a variety of tasks, but deep neural networks (DNNs) are shown to produce highly overconfident scores for even abnormal samples. Well-defined uncertainty indicates whether a model's output should (or should not) be trusted and thus becomes critical in real-world scenarios which typically involves shifted input distributions due to many factors. Existing uncertainty approaches assume that testing samples from a different data distribution would induce unreliable model predictions thus have higher uncertainty scores. They quantify model uncertainty by calibrating DL model's confidence of a given input and evaluate the effectiveness in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)-related tasks. However, their methodologies' reliability may be compromised under programming tasks due to difference in data representations and shift patterns. In this paper, we first define three different types of distribution shift in program data and build a large-scale shifted Java dataset. We implement two common programming language tasks on our dataset to study the effect of each distribution shift on DL model performance. We also propose a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art predictive uncertainty on programming tasks and investigate their effectiveness under data distribution shift. Experiments show that program distribution shift does degrade the DL model performance to varying degrees and that existing uncertainty methods all present certain limitations in quantifying uncertainty on program dataset. </description>

      <title>Ready for Emerging Threats to Recommender Systems? A Graph Convolution-based Generative Shilling Attack. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10457</link>
      <description>  To explore the robustness of recommender systems, researchers have proposed various shilling attack models and analyzed their adverse effects. Primitive attacks are highly feasible but less effective due to simplistic handcrafted rules, while upgraded attacks are more powerful but costly and difficult to deploy because they require more knowledge from recommendations. In this paper, we explore a novel shilling attack called Graph cOnvolution-based generative shilling ATtack (GOAT) to balance the attacks' feasibility and effectiveness. GOAT adopts the primitive attacks' paradigm that assigns items for fake users by sampling and the upgraded attacks' paradigm that generates fake ratings by a deep learning-based model. It deploys a generative adversarial network (GAN) that learns the real rating distribution to generate fake ratings. Additionally, the generator combines a tailored graph convolution structure that leverages the correlations between co-rated items to smoothen the fake ratings and enhance their authenticity. The extensive experiments on two public datasets evaluate GOAT's performance from multiple perspectives. Our study of the GOAT demonstrates technical feasibility for building a more powerful and intelligent attack model with a much-reduced cost, enables analysis the threat of such an attack and guides for investigating necessary prevention measures. </description>

      <title>Fast and Scalable Adversarial Training of Kernel SVM via Doubly Stochastic Gradients. (98%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09937</link>
      <description>  Adversarial attacks by generating examples which are almost indistinguishable from natural examples, pose a serious threat to learning models. Defending against adversarial attacks is a critical element for a reliable learning system. Support vector machine (SVM) is a classical yet still important learning algorithm even in the current deep learning era. Although a wide range of researches have been done in recent years to improve the adversarial robustness of learning models, but most of them are limited to deep neural networks (DNNs) and the work for kernel SVM is still vacant. In this paper, we aim at kernel SVM and propose adv-SVM to improve its adversarial robustness via adversarial training, which has been demonstrated to be the most promising defense techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that devotes to the fast and scalable adversarial training of kernel SVM. Specifically, we first build connection of perturbations of samples between original and kernel spaces, and then give a reduced and equivalent formulation of adversarial training of kernel SVM based on the connection. Next, doubly stochastic gradients (DSG) based on two unbiased stochastic approximations (i.e., one is on training points and another is on random features) are applied to update the solution of our objective function. Finally, we prove that our algorithm optimized by DSG converges to the optimal solution at the rate of O(1/t) under the constant and diminishing stepsizes. Comprehensive experimental results show that our adversarial training algorithm enjoys robustness against various attacks and meanwhile has the similar efficiency and scalability with classical DSG algorithm. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10137</link>
      <description>  We propose a simple and general method to regularize the fine-tuning of Transformer-based encoders for text classification tasks. Specifically, during fine-tuning we generate adversarial examples by perturbing the word embeddings of the model and perform contrastive learning on clean and adversarial examples in order to teach the model to learn noise-invariant representations. By training on both clean and adversarial examples along with the additional contrastive objective, we observe consistent improvement over standard fine-tuning on clean examples. On several GLUE benchmark tasks, our fine-tuned BERT Large model outperforms BERT Large baseline by 1.7% on average, and our fine-tuned RoBERTa Large improves over RoBERTa Large baseline by 1.3%. We additionally validate our method in different domains using three intent classification datasets, where our fine-tuned RoBERTa Large outperforms RoBERTa Large baseline by 1-2% on average. </description>

      <title>Black-box Probe for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation without Model Transferring. (81%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10174</link>
      <description>  In recent years, researchers have been paying increasing attention to the threats brought by deep learning models to data security and privacy, especially in the field of domain adaptation. Existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods can achieve promising performance without transferring data from source domain to target domain. However, UDA with representation alignment or self-supervised pseudo-labeling relies on the transferred source models. In many data-critical scenarios, methods based on model transferring may suffer from membership inference attacks and expose private data. In this paper, we aim to overcome a challenging new setting where the source models are only queryable but cannot be transferred to the target domain. We propose Black-box Probe Domain Adaptation (BPDA), which adopts query mechanism to probe and refine information from source model using third-party dataset. In order to gain more informative query results, we further propose Distributionally Adversarial Training (DAT) to align the distribution of third-party data with that of target data. BPDA uses public third-party dataset and adversarial examples based on DAT as the information carrier between source and target domains, dispensing with transferring source data or model. Experimental results on benchmarks of Digit-Five, Office-Caltech, Office-31, Office-Home, and DomainNet demonstrate the feasibility of BPDA without model transferring. </description>

      <title>Defending against Reconstruction Attack in Vertical Federated Learning. (10%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09898</link>
      <description>  Recently researchers have studied input leakage problems in Federated Learning (FL) where a malicious party can reconstruct sensitive training inputs provided by users from shared gradient. It raises concerns about FL since input leakage contradicts the privacy-preserving intention of using FL. Despite a relatively rich literature on attacks and defenses of input reconstruction in Horizontal FL, input leakage and protection in vertical FL starts to draw researcher's attention recently. In this paper, we study how to defend against input leakage attacks in Vertical FL. We design an adversarial training-based framework that contains three modules: adversarial reconstruction, noise regularization, and distance correlation minimization. Those modules can not only be employed individually but also applied together since they are independent to each other. Through extensive experiments on a large-scale industrial online advertising dataset, we show our framework is effective in protecting input privacy while retaining the model utility. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10139</link>
      <description>  Generative models learn the distribution of data from a sample dataset and can then generate new data instances. Recent advances in deep learning has brought forth improvements in generative model architectures, and some state-of-the-art models can (in some cases) produce outputs realistic enough to fool humans.   We survey recent research at the intersection of security and privacy and generative models. In particular, we discuss the use of generative models in adversarial machine learning, in helping automate or enhance existing attacks, and as building blocks for defenses in contexts such as intrusion detection, biometrics spoofing, and malware obfuscation. We also describe the use of generative models in diverse applications such as fairness in machine learning, privacy-preserving data synthesis, and steganography.

      <title>A Tandem Framework Balancing Privacy and Security for Voice User Interfaces. (5%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10045</link>
      <description>  Speech synthesis, voice cloning, and voice conversion techniques present severe privacy and security threats to users of voice user interfaces (VUIs). These techniques transform one or more elements of a speech signal, e.g., identity and emotion, while preserving linguistic information. Adversaries may use advanced transformation tools to trigger a spoofing attack using fraudulent biometrics for a legitimate speaker. Conversely, such techniques have been used to generate privacy-transformed speech by suppressing personally identifiable attributes in the voice signals, achieving anonymization. Prior works have studied the security and privacy vectors in parallel, and thus it raises alarm that if a benign user can achieve privacy by a transformation, it also means that a malicious user can break security by bypassing the anti-spoofing mechanism. In this paper, we take a step towards balancing two seemingly conflicting requirements: security and privacy. It remains unclear what the vulnerabilities in one domain imply for the other, and what dynamic interactions exist between them. A better understanding of these aspects is crucial for assessing and mitigating vulnerabilities inherent with VUIs and building effective defenses. In this paper,(i) we investigate the applicability of the current voice anonymization methods by deploying a tandem framework that jointly combines anti-spoofing and authentication models, and evaluate the performance of these methods;(ii) examining analytical and empirical evidence, we reveal a duality between the two mechanisms as they offer different ways to achieve the same objective, and we show that leveraging one vector significantly amplifies the effectiveness of the other;(iii) we demonstrate that to effectively defend from potential attacks against VUIs, it is necessary to investigate the attacks from multiple complementary perspectives(security and privacy). </description>

      <title>Spinning Sequence-to-Sequence Models with Meta-Backdoors. (4%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10443</link>
      <description>  We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models: training-time attacks that cause models to &quot;spin&quot; their output and support a certain sentiment when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a summarization model will output positive summaries of any text that mentions the name of some individual or organization.   We introduce the concept of a &quot;meta-backdoor&quot; to explain model-spinning attacks. These attacks produce models whose output is valid and preserves context, yet also satisfies a meta-task chosen by the adversary (e.g., positive sentiment). Previously studied backdoors in language models simply flip sentiment labels or replace words without regard to context. Their outputs are incorrect on inputs with the trigger. Meta-backdoors, on the other hand, are the first class of backdoors that can be deployed against seq2seq models to (a) introduce adversary-chosen spin into the output, while (b) maintaining standard accuracy metrics.   To demonstrate feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new backdooring technique. It stacks the adversarial meta-task (e.g., sentiment analysis) onto a seq2seq model, backpropagates the desired meta-task output (e.g., positive sentiment) to points in the word-embedding space we call &quot;pseudo-words,&quot; and uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output distribution of the seq2seq model. Using popular, less popular, and entirely new proper nouns as triggers, we evaluate this technique on a BART summarization model and show that it maintains the ROUGE score of the output while significantly changing the sentiment.   We explain why model spinning can be a dangerous technique in AI-powered disinformation and discuss how to mitigate these attacks. </description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Prior-Guided Zeroth-Order Optimization Algorithms. (2%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10110</link>
      <description>  Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization is widely used to handle challenging tasks, such as query-based black-box adversarial attacks and reinforcement learning. Various attempts have been made to integrate prior information into the gradient estimation procedure based on finite differences, with promising empirical results. However, their convergence properties are not well understood. This paper makes an attempt to fill this gap by analyzing the convergence of prior-guided ZO algorithms under a greedy descent framework with various gradient estimators. We provide a convergence guarantee for the prior-guided random gradient-free (PRGF) algorithms. Moreover, to further accelerate over greedy descent methods, we present a new accelerated random search (ARS) algorithm that incorporates prior information, together with a convergence analysis. Finally, our theoretical results are confirmed by experiments on several numerical benchmarks as well as adversarial attacks. </description>

      <title>Using Undervolting as an On-Device Defense Against Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09804</link>
      <description>  Deep neural network (DNN) classifiers are powerful tools that drive a broad spectrum of important applications, from image recognition to autonomous vehicles. Unfortunately, DNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks that affect virtually all state-of-the-art models. These attacks make small imperceptible modifications to inputs that are sufficient to induce the DNNs to produce the wrong classification.   In this paper we propose a novel, lightweight adversarial correction and/or detection mechanism for image classifiers that relies on undervolting (running a chip at a voltage that is slightly below its safe margin). We propose using controlled undervolting of the chip running the inference process in order to introduce a limited number of compute errors. We show that these errors disrupt the adversarial input in a way that can be used either to correct the classification or detect the input as adversarial. We evaluate the proposed solution in an FPGA design and through software simulation. We evaluate 10 attacks on two popular DNNs and show an average detection rate of 80% to 95%. </description>

      <title>A Markov Game Model for AI-based Cyber Security Attack Mitigation. (10%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09258</link>
      <description>  The new generation of cyber threats leverages advanced AI-aided methods, which make them capable to launch multi-stage, dynamic, and effective attacks. Current cyber-defense systems encounter various challenges to defend against such new and emerging threats. Modeling AI-aided threats through game theory models can help the defender to select optimal strategies against the attacks and make wise decisions to mitigate the attack's impact. This paper first explores the current state-of-the-art in the new generation of threats in which AI techniques such as deep neural network is used for the attacker and discusses further challenges. We propose a Markovian dynamic game that can evaluate the efficiency of defensive methods against the AI-aided attacker under a cloud-based system in which the attacker utilizes an AI technique to launch an advanced attack by finding the shortest attack path. We use the CVSS metrics to quantify the values of this zero-sum game model for decision-making. </description>

      <title>Leaking Secrets through Modern Branch Predictor in the Speculative World. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09833</link>
      <description>  Transient execution attacks that exploit speculation have raised significant concerns in computer systems. Typically, branch predictors are leveraged to trigger mis-speculation in transient execution attacks. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of speculation-based attack that targets branch prediction unit (BPU). We find that speculative resolution of conditional branches (i.e., in nested speculation) alter the states of pattern history table (PHT) in modern processors, which are not restored after the corresponding branches are later squashed. Such characteristic allows attackers to exploit BPU as the secret transmitting medium in transient execution attacks. To evaluate the discovered vulnerability, we build a novel attack framework, BranchSpectre, that enables exfiltration of unintended secrets through observing speculative PHT updates (in the form of covert and side channels). We further investigate PHT collision mechanism in the history-based predictor as well as the branch prediction mode transitions in Intel processors. Built upon such knowledge, we implement an ultra high-speed covert channel (BranchSpectre-cc) as well as two side channels (i.e., BranchSpectre-v1 and BranchSpectre-v2) that merely rely on BPU for mis-speculation trigger and secret inference in the speculative domain. Notably, BranchSpectre side channels can take advantage of much simpler code patterns than the ones used in Spectre attacks. We present an extensive BranchSpectre code gadget analysis on a set of popular real-world application code bases followed by a demonstration of real-world side channel attack on OpenSSL. The evaluation results show substantial wider existence and higher exploitability of BranchSpectre code patterns in real-world software. Finally, we discuss several secure branch prediction mechanisms that can mitigate transient execution attacks exploiting modern branch predictors. </description>

      <title>Discriminator-Free Generative Adversarial Attack. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09225</link>
      <description>  The Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable toadversarial exam-ples(Figure 1), making the DNNs-based systems collapsed byadding the inconspicuous perturbations to the images. Most of the existing works for adversarial attack are gradient-based and suf-fer from the latency efficiencies and the load on GPU memory. Thegenerative-based adversarial attacks can get rid of this limitation,and some relative works propose the approaches based on GAN.However, suffering from the difficulty of the convergence of train-ing a GAN, the adversarial examples have either bad attack abilityor bad visual quality. In this work, we find that the discriminatorcould be not necessary for generative-based adversarial attack, andpropose theSymmetric Saliency-based Auto-Encoder (SSAE)to generate the perturbations, which is composed of the saliencymap module and the angle-norm disentanglement of the featuresmodule. The advantage of our proposed method lies in that it is notdepending on discriminator, and uses the generative saliency map to pay more attention to label-relevant regions. The extensive exper-iments among the various tasks, datasets, and models demonstratethat the adversarial examples generated by SSAE not only make thewidely-used models collapse, but also achieves good visual quality.The code is available at https://github.com/BravoLu/SSAE. </description>

      <title>Feature-Filter: Detecting Adversarial Examples through Filtering off Recessive Features. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09502</link>
      <description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are under threat from adversarial example attacks. The adversary can easily change the outputs of DNNs by adding small well-designed perturbations to inputs. Adversarial example detection is a fundamental work for robust DNNs-based service. Adversarial examples show the difference between humans and DNNs in image recognition. From a human-centric perspective, image features could be divided into dominant features that are comprehensible to humans, and recessive features that are incomprehensible to humans, yet are exploited by DNNs. In this paper, we reveal that imperceptible adversarial examples are the product of recessive features misleading neural networks, and an adversarial attack is essentially a kind of method to enrich these recessive features in the image. The imperceptibility of the adversarial examples indicates that the perturbations enrich recessive features, yet hardly affect dominant features. Therefore, adversarial examples are sensitive to filtering off recessive features, while benign examples are immune to such operation. Inspired by this idea, we propose a label-only adversarial detection approach that is referred to as feature-filter. Feature-filter utilizes discrete cosine transform to approximately separate recessive features from dominant features, and gets a mutant image that is filtered off recessive features. By only comparing DNN's prediction labels on the input and its mutant, feature-filter can real-time detect imperceptible adversarial examples at high accuracy and few false positives. </description>

      <title>Examining the Human Perceptibility of Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Face Recognition. (98%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09126</link>
      <description>  The modern open internet contains billions of public images of human faces across the web, especially on social media websites used by half the world's population. In this context, Face Recognition (FR) systems have the potential to match faces to specific names and identities, creating glaring privacy concerns. Adversarial attacks are a promising way to grant users privacy from FR systems by disrupting their capability to recognize faces. Yet, such attacks can be perceptible to human observers, especially under the more challenging black-box threat model. In the literature, the justification for the imperceptibility of such attacks hinges on bounding metrics such as $\ell_p$ norms. However, there is not much research on how these norms match up with human perception. Through examining and measuring both the effectiveness of recent black-box attacks in the face recognition setting and their corresponding human perceptibility through survey data, we demonstrate the trade-offs in perceptibility that occur as attacks become more aggressive. We also show how the $\ell_2$ norm and other metrics do not correlate with human perceptibility in a linear fashion, thus making these norms suboptimal at measuring adversarial attack perceptibility. </description>

      <title>On the Veracity of Local, Model-agnostic Explanations in Audio Classification: Targeted Investigations with Adversarial Examples. (80%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09045</link>
      <description>  Local explanation methods such as LIME have become popular in MIR as tools for generating post-hoc, model-agnostic explanations of a model's classification decisions. The basic idea is to identify a small set of human-understandable features of the classified example that are most influential on the classifier's prediction. These are then presented as an explanation. Evaluation of such explanations in publications often resorts to accepting what matches the expectation of a human without actually being able to verify if what the explanation shows is what really caused the model's prediction. This paper reports on targeted investigations where we try to get more insight into the actual veracity of LIME's explanations in an audio classification task. We deliberately design adversarial examples for the classifier, in a way that gives us knowledge about which parts of the input are potentially responsible for the model's (wrong) prediction. Asking LIME to explain the predictions for these adversaries permits us to study whether local explanations do indeed detect these regions of interest. We also look at whether LIME is more successful in finding perturbations that are more prominent and easily noticeable for a human. Our results suggest that LIME does not necessarily manage to identify the most relevant input features and hence it remains unclear whether explanations are useful or even misleading. </description>

      <title>MEGEX: Data-Free Model Extraction Attack against Gradient-Based Explainable AI. (33%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08909</link>
      <description>  The advance of explainable artificial intelligence, which provides reasons for its predictions, is expected to accelerate the use of deep neural networks in the real world like Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) that returns predictions on queried data with the trained model. Deep neural networks deployed in MLaaS face the threat of model extraction attacks. A model extraction attack is an attack to violate intellectual property and privacy in which an adversary steals trained models in a cloud using only their predictions. In particular, a data-free model extraction attack has been proposed recently and is more critical. In this attack, an adversary uses a generative model instead of preparing input data. The feasibility of this attack, however, needs to be studied since it requires more queries than that with surrogate datasets. In this paper, we propose MEGEX, a data-free model extraction attack against a gradient-based explainable AI. In this method, an adversary uses the explanations to train the generative model and reduces the number of queries to steal the model. Our experiments show that our proposed method reconstructs high-accuracy models -- 0.97$\times$ and 0.98$\times$ the victim model accuracy on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets given 2M and 20M queries, respectively. This implies that there is a trade-off between the interpretability of models and the difficulty of stealing them. </description>

      <title>Structural Watermarking to Deep Neural Networks via Network Channel Pruning. (11%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08688</link>
      <description>  In order to protect the intellectual property (IP) of deep neural networks (DNNs), many existing DNN watermarking techniques either embed watermarks directly into the DNN parameters or insert backdoor watermarks by fine-tuning the DNN parameters, which, however, cannot resist against various attack methods that remove watermarks by altering DNN parameters. In this paper, we bypass such attacks by introducing a structural watermarking scheme that utilizes channel pruning to embed the watermark into the host DNN architecture instead of crafting the DNN parameters. To be specific, during watermark embedding, we prune the internal channels of the host DNN with the channel pruning rates controlled by the watermark. During watermark extraction, the watermark is retrieved by identifying the channel pruning rates from the architecture of the target DNN model. Due to the superiority of pruning mechanism, the performance of the DNN model on its original task is reserved during watermark embedding. Experimental results have shown that, the proposed work enables the embedded watermark to be reliably recovered and provides a high watermark capacity, without sacrificing the usability of the DNN model. It is also demonstrated that the work is robust against common transforms and attacks designed for conventional watermarking approaches. </description>

      <title>Improving Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks in Medical Diagnosis by Investigating the Individual Units. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08767</link>
      <description>  As interpretability has been pointed out as the obstacle to the adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), there is an increasing interest in solving a transparency issue to guarantee the impressive performance. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficiency of recent attribution techniques to explain the diagnostic decision by visualizing the significant factors in the input image. By utilizing the characteristics of objectness that DNNs have learned, fully decomposing the network prediction visualizes clear localization of target lesion. To verify our work, we conduct our experiments on Chest X-ray diagnosis with publicly accessible datasets. As an intuitive assessment metric for explanations, we report the performance of intersection of Union between visual explanation and bounding box of lesions. Experiment results show that recently proposed attribution methods visualize the more accurate localization for the diagnostic decision compared to the traditionally used CAM. Furthermore, we analyze the inconsistency of intentions between humans and DNNs, which is easily obscured by high performance. By visualizing the relevant factors, it is possible to confirm that the criterion for decision is in line with the learning strategy. Our analysis of unmasking machine intelligence represents the necessity of explainability in the medical diagnostic decision. </description>

      <title>Just Train Twice: Improving Group Robustness without Training Group Information. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09044</link>
      <description>  Standard training via empirical risk minimization (ERM) can produce models that achieve high accuracy on average but low accuracy on certain groups, especially in the presence of spurious correlations between the input and label. Prior approaches that achieve high worst-group accuracy, like group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) require expensive group annotations for each training point, whereas approaches that do not use such group annotations typically achieve unsatisfactory worst-group accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple two-stage approach, JTT, that first trains a standard ERM model for several epochs, and then trains a second model that upweights the training examples that the first model misclassified. Intuitively, this upweights examples from groups on which standard ERM models perform poorly, leading to improved worst-group performance. Averaged over four image classification and natural language processing tasks with spurious correlations, JTT closes 75% of the gap in worst-group accuracy between standard ERM and group DRO, while only requiring group annotations on a small validation set in order to tune hyperparameters. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08402</link>
      <description>  Federated learning is a prominent framework that enables clients (e.g., mobile devices or organizations) to train a collaboratively global model under a central server's orchestration while keeping local training datasets' privacy. However, the aggregation step in federated learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks as the central server cannot manage clients' behavior. Therefore, the global model's performance and convergence of the training process will be affected under such attacks.To mitigate this vulnerability issue, we propose a novel robust aggregation algorithm inspired by the truth inference methods in crowdsourcing via incorporating the worker's reliability into aggregation. We evaluate our solution on three real-world datasets with a variety of machine learning models. Experimental results show that our solution ensures robust federated learning and is resilient to various types of attacks, including noisy data attacks, Byzantine attacks, and label flipping attacks. </description>

      <title>BEDS-Bench: Behavior of EHR-models under Distributional Shift--A Benchmark. (9%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08189</link>
      <description>  Machine learning has recently demonstrated impressive progress in predictive accuracy across a wide array of tasks. Most ML approaches focus on generalization performance on unseen data that are similar to the training data (In-Distribution, or IND). However, real world applications and deployments of ML rarely enjoy the comfort of encountering examples that are always IND. In such situations, most ML models commonly display erratic behavior on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, such as assigning high confidence to wrong predictions, or vice-versa. Implications of such unusual model behavior are further exacerbated in the healthcare setting, where patient health can potentially be put at risk. It is crucial to study the behavior and robustness properties of models under distributional shift, understand common failure modes, and take mitigation steps before the model is deployed. Having a benchmark that shines light upon these aspects of a model is a first and necessary step in addressing the issue. Recent work and interest in increasing model robustness in OOD settings have focused more on image modality, while the Electronic Health Record (EHR) modality is still largely under-explored. We aim to bridge this gap by releasing BEDS-Bench, a benchmark for quantifying the behavior of ML models over EHR data under OOD settings. We use two open access, de-identified EHR datasets to construct several OOD data settings to run tests on, and measure relevant metrics that characterize crucial aspects of a model's OOD behavior. We evaluate several learning algorithms under BEDS-Bench and find that all of them show poor generalization performance under distributional shift in general. Our results highlight the need and the potential to improve robustness of EHR models under distributional shift, and BEDS-Bench provides one way to measure progress towards that goal. </description>

      <title>EGC2: Enhanced Graph Classification with Easy Graph Compression. (84%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07737</link>
      <description>  Graph classification plays a significant role in network analysis. It also faces potential security threat like adversarial attacks. Some defense methods may sacrifice algorithm complexity for robustness like adversarial training, while others may sacrifice the clean example performance such as smoothing-based defense. Most of them are suffered from high-complexity or less transferability. To address this problem, we proposed EGC$^2$, an enhanced graph classification model with easy graph compression. EGC$^2$ captures the relationship between features of different nodes by constructing feature graphs and improving aggregate node-level representation. To achieve lower complexity defense applied to various graph classification models, EGC$^2$ utilizes a centrality-based edge importance index to compress graphs, filtering out trivial structures and even adversarial perturbations of the input graphs, thus improves its robustness. Experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed feature read-out and graph compression mechanisms enhance the robustness of various basic models, thus achieving the state-of-the-art performance of accuracy and robustness in the threat of different adversarial attacks. </description>

      <description>  This is the Proceedings of ICML 2021 Workshop on Theoretic Foundation, Criticism, and Application Trend of Explainable AI. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have undoubtedly brought great success to a wide range of applications in computer vision, computational linguistics, and AI. However, foundational principles underlying the DNNs' success and their resilience to adversarial attacks are still largely missing. Interpreting and theorizing the internal mechanisms of DNNs becomes a compelling yet controversial topic. This workshop pays a special interest in theoretic foundations, limitations, and new application trends in the scope of XAI. These issues reflect new bottlenecks in the future development of XAI. </description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Perturbations for Robust Pretrained Language Models. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07610</link>
      <description>  This paper improves the robustness of the pretrained language model BERT against word substitution-based adversarial attacks by leveraging self-supervised contrastive learning with adversarial perturbations. One advantage of our method compared to previous works is that it is capable of improving model robustness without using any labels. Additionally, we also create an adversarial attack for word-level adversarial training on BERT. The attack is efficient, allowing adversarial training for BERT on adversarial examples generated on the fly during training. Experimental results on four datasets show that our method improves the robustness of BERT against four different word substitution-based adversarial attacks. Furthermore, to understand why our method can improve the model robustness against adversarial attacks, we study vector representations of clean examples and their corresponding adversarial examples before and after applying our method. As our method improves model robustness with unlabeled raw data, it opens up the possibility of using large text datasets to train robust language models. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07449</link>
      <description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have accomplished impressive success in various applications, including autonomous driving perception tasks, in recent years. On the other hand, current deep neural networks are easily fooled by adversarial attacks. This vulnerability raises significant concerns, particularly in safety-critical applications. As a result, research into attacking and defending DNNs has gained much coverage. In this work, detailed adversarial attacks are applied on a diverse multi-task visual perception deep network across distance estimation, semantic segmentation, motion detection, and object detection. The experiments consider both white and black box attacks for targeted and un-targeted cases, while attacking a task and inspecting the effect on all the others, in addition to inspecting the effect of applying a simple defense method. We conclude this paper by comparing and discussing the experimental results, proposing insights and future work. The visualizations of the attacks are available at https://youtu.be/R3JUV41aiPY. </description>

      <title>ECG-Adv-GAN: Detecting ECG Adversarial Examples with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks. (92%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07677</link>
      <description>  Electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition requires an automated system and analysis pipeline for understanding specific rhythm irregularities. Deep neural networks have become a popular technique for tracing ECG signals, outperforming human experts. Despite this, convolutional neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples that can misclassify ECG signals and decrease the model's precision. Moreover, they do not generalize well on the out-of-distribution dataset. The GAN architecture has been employed in recent works to synthesize adversarial ECG signals to increase existing training data. However, they use a disjointed CNN-based classification architecture to detect arrhythmia. Till now, no versatile architecture has been proposed that can detect adversarial examples and classify arrhythmia simultaneously. To alleviate this, we propose a novel Conditional Generative Adversarial Network to simultaneously generate ECG signals for different categories and detect cardiac abnormalities. Moreover, the model is conditioned on class-specific ECG signals to synthesize realistic adversarial examples. Consequently, we compare our architecture and show how it outperforms other classification models in normal/abnormal ECG signal detection by benchmarking real world and adversarial signals. </description>

      <title>Adversarial Attack for Uncertainty Estimation: Identifying Critical Regions in Neural Networks. (80%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07618</link>
      <description>  We propose a novel method to capture data points near decision boundary in neural network that are often referred to a specific type of uncertainty. In our approach, we sought to perform uncertainty estimation based on the idea of adversarial attack method. In this paper, uncertainty estimates are derived from the input perturbations, unlike previous studies that provide perturbations on the model's parameters as in Bayesian approach. We are able to produce uncertainty with couple of perturbations on the inputs. Interestingly, we apply the proposed method to datasets derived from blockchain. We compare the performance of model uncertainty with the most recent uncertainty methods. We show that the proposed method has revealed a significant outperformance over other methods and provided less risk to capture model uncertainty in machine learning. </description>

      <title>Subnet Replacement: Deployment-stage backdoor attack against deep neural networks in gray-box setting. (16%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07240</link>
      <description>  We study the realistic potential of conducting backdoor attack against deep neural networks (DNNs) during deployment stage. Specifically, our goal is to design a deployment-stage backdoor attack algorithm that is both threatening and realistically implementable. To this end, we propose Subnet Replacement Attack (SRA), which is capable of embedding backdoor into DNNs by directly modifying a limited number of model parameters. Considering the realistic practicability, we abandon the strong white-box assumption widely adopted in existing studies, instead, our algorithm works in a gray-box setting, where architecture information of the victim model is available but the adversaries do not have any knowledge of parameter values. The key philosophy underlying our approach is -- given any neural network instance (regardless of its specific parameter values) of a certain architecture, we can always embed a backdoor into that model instance, by replacing a very narrow subnet of a benign model (without backdoor) with a malicious backdoor subnet, which is designed to be sensitive (fire large activation value) to a particular backdoor trigger pattern. </description>

      <title>Shifts: A Dataset of Real Distributional Shift Across Multiple Large-Scale Tasks. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07455</link>
      <description>  There has been significant research done on developing methods for improving robustness to distributional shift and uncertainty estimation. In contrast, only limited work has examined developing standard datasets and benchmarks for assessing these approaches. Additionally, most work on uncertainty estimation and robustness has developed new techniques based on small-scale regression or image classification tasks. However, many tasks of practical interest have different modalities, such as tabular data, audio, text, or sensor data, which offer significant challenges involving regression and discrete or continuous structured prediction. Thus, given the current state of the field, a standardized large-scale dataset of tasks across a range of modalities affected by distributional shifts is necessary. This will enable researchers to meaningfully evaluate the plethora of recently developed uncertainty quantification methods, as well as assessment criteria and state-of-the-art baselines. In this work, we propose the \emph{Shifts Dataset} for evaluation of uncertainty estimates and robustness to distributional shift. The dataset, which has been collected from industrial sources and services, is composed of three tasks, with each corresponding to a particular data modality: tabular weather prediction, machine translation, and self-driving car (SDC) vehicle motion prediction. All of these data modalities and tasks are affected by real, `in-the-wild' distributional shifts and pose interesting challenges with respect to uncertainty estimation. In this work we provide a description of the dataset and baseline results for all tasks. </description>

      <title>AdvFilter: Predictive Perturbation-aware Filtering against Adversarial Attack via Multi-domain Learning. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06501</link>
      <description>  High-level representation-guided pixel denoising and adversarial training are independent solutions to enhance the robustness of CNNs against adversarial attacks by pre-processing input data and re-training models, respectively. Most recently, adversarial training techniques have been widely studied and improved while the pixel denoising-based method is getting less attractive. However, it is still questionable whether there exists a more advanced pixel denoising-based method and whether the combination of the two solutions benefits each other. To this end, we first comprehensively investigate two kinds of pixel denoising methods for adversarial robustness enhancement (i.e., existing additive-based and unexplored filtering-based methods) under the loss functions of image-level and semantic-level restorations, respectively, showing that pixel-wise filtering can obtain much higher image quality (e.g., higher PSNR) as well as higher robustness (e.g., higher accuracy on adversarial examples) than existing pixel-wise additive-based method. However, we also observe that the robustness results of the filtering-based method rely on the perturbation amplitude of adversarial examples used for training. To address this problem, we propose predictive perturbation-aware pixel-wise filtering, where dual-perturbation filtering and an uncertainty-aware fusion module are designed and employed to automatically perceive the perturbation amplitude during the training and testing process. The proposed method is termed as AdvFilter. Moreover, we combine adversarial pixel denoising methods with three adversarial training-based methods, hinting that considering data and models jointly is able to achieve more robust CNNs. The experiments conduct on NeurIPS-2017DEV, SVHN, and CIFAR10 datasets and show the advantages over enhancing CNNs' robustness, high generalization to different models, and noise levels. </description>

      <title>Conservative Objective Models for Effective Offline Model-Based Optimization. (67%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06882</link>
      <description>  Computational design problems arise in a number of settings, from synthetic biology to computer architectures. In this paper, we aim to solve data-driven model-based optimization (MBO) problems, where the goal is to find a design input that maximizes an unknown objective function provided access to only a static dataset of prior experiments. Such data-driven optimization procedures are the only practical methods in many real-world domains where active data collection is expensive (e.g., when optimizing over proteins) or dangerous (e.g., when optimizing over aircraft designs). Typical methods for MBO that optimize the design against a learned model suffer from distributional shift: it is easy to find a design that &quot;fools&quot; the model into predicting a high value. To overcome this, we propose conservative objective models (COMs), a method that learns a model of the objective function that lower bounds the actual value of the ground-truth objective on out-of-distribution inputs, and uses it for optimization. Structurally, COMs resemble adversarial training methods used to overcome adversarial examples. COMs are simple to implement and outperform a number of existing methods on a wide range of MBO problems, including optimizing protein sequences, robot morphologies, neural network weights, and superconducting materials. </description>

      <title>AID-Purifier: A Light Auxiliary Network for Boosting Adversarial Defense. (88%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06456</link>
      <description>  We propose an AID-purifier that can boost the robustness of adversarially-trained networks by purifying their inputs. AID-purifier is an auxiliary network that works as an add-on to an already trained main classifier. To keep it computationally light, it is trained as a discriminator with a binary cross-entropy loss. To obtain additionally useful information from the adversarial examples, the architecture design is closely related to information maximization principles where two layers of the main classification network are piped to the auxiliary network. To assist the iterative optimization procedure of purification, the auxiliary network is trained with AVmixup. AID-purifier can be used together with other purifiers such as PixelDefend for an extra enhancement. The overall results indicate that the best performing adversarially-trained networks can be enhanced by the best performing purification networks, where AID-purifier is a competitive candidate that is light and robust. </description>

      <title>Using BERT Encoding to Tackle the Mad-lib Attack in SMS Spam Detection. (69%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06400</link>
      <description>  One of the stratagems used to deceive spam filters is to substitute vocables with synonyms or similar words that turn the message unrecognisable by the detection algorithms. In this paper we investigate whether the recent development of language models sensitive to the semantics and context of words, such as Google's BERT, may be useful to overcome this adversarial attack (called &quot;Mad-lib&quot; as per the word substitution game). Using a dataset of 5572 SMS spam messages, we first established a baseline of detection performance using widely known document representation models (BoW and TFIDF) and the novel BERT model, coupled with a variety of classification algorithms (Decision Tree, kNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron). Then, we built a thesaurus of the vocabulary contained in these messages, and set up a Mad-lib attack experiment in which we modified each message of a held out subset of data (not used in the baseline experiment) with different rates of substitution of original words with synonyms from the thesaurus. Lastly, we evaluated the detection performance of the three representation models (BoW, TFIDF and BERT) coupled with the best classifier from the baseline experiment (SVM). We found that the classic models achieved a 94% Balanced Accuracy (BA) in the original dataset, whereas the BERT model obtained 96%. On the other hand, the Mad-lib attack experiment showed that BERT encodings manage to maintain a similar BA performance of 96% with an average substitution rate of 1.82 words per message, and 95% with 3.34 words substituted per message. In contrast, the BA performance of the BoW and TFIDF encoders dropped to chance. These results hint at the potential advantage of BERT models to combat these type of ingenious attacks, offsetting to some extent for the inappropriate use of semantic relationships in language. </description>

      <title>Correlation Analysis between the Robustness of Sparse Neural Networks and their Random Hidden Structural Priors. (41%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06158</link>
      <description>  Deep learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This perception led to analyzing deep learning models not only from the perspective of their performance measures but also their robustness to certain types of adversarial attacks. We take another step forward in relating the architectural structure of neural networks from a graph theoretic perspective to their robustness. We aim to investigate any existing correlations between graph theoretic properties and the robustness of Sparse Neural Networks. Our hypothesis is, that graph theoretic properties as a prior of neural network structures are related to their robustness. To answer to this hypothesis, we designed an empirical study with neural network models obtained through random graphs used as sparse structural priors for the networks. We additionally investigated the evaluation of a randomly pruned fully connected network as a point of reference.   We found that robustness measures are independent of initialization methods but show weak correlations with graph properties: higher graph densities correlate with lower robustness, but higher average path lengths and average node eccentricities show negative correlations with robustness measures. We hope to motivate further empirical and analytical research to tightening an answer to our hypothesis. </description>

      <title>What classifiers know what they don't? (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06217</link>
      <description>  Being uncertain when facing the unknown is key to intelligent decision making. However, machine learning algorithms lack reliable estimates about their predictive uncertainty. This leads to wrong and overly-confident decisions when encountering classes unseen during training. Despite the importance of equipping classifiers with uncertainty estimates ready for the real world, prior work has focused on small datasets and little or no class discrepancy between training and testing data. To close this gap, we introduce UIMNET: a realistic, ImageNet-scale test-bed to evaluate predictive uncertainty estimates for deep image classifiers. Our benchmark provides implementations of eight state-of-the-art algorithms, six uncertainty measures, four in-domain metrics, three out-domain metrics, and a fully automated pipeline to train, calibrate, ensemble, select, and evaluate models. Our test-bed is open-source and all of our results are reproducible from a fixed commit in our repository. Adding new datasets, algorithms, measures, or metrics is a matter of a few lines of code-in so hoping that UIMNET becomes a stepping stone towards realistic, rigorous, and reproducible research in uncertainty estimation. Our results show that ensembles of ERM classifiers as well as single MIMO classifiers are the two best alternatives currently available to measure uncertainty about both in-domain and out-domain classes. </description>

      <title>EvoBA: An Evolution Strategy as a Strong Baseline forBlack-Box Adversarial Attacks. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05754</link>
      <description>  Recent work has shown how easily white-box adversarial attacks can be applied to state-of-the-art image classifiers. However, real-life scenarios resemble more the black-box adversarial conditions, lacking transparency and usually imposing natural, hard constraints on the query budget.   We propose $\textbf{EvoBA}$, a black-box adversarial attack based on a surprisingly simple evolutionary search strategy. $\textbf{EvoBA}$ is query-efficient, minimizes $L_0$ adversarial perturbations, and does not require any form of training.   $\textbf{EvoBA}$ shows efficiency and efficacy through results that are in line with much more complex state-of-the-art black-box attacks such as $\textbf{AutoZOOM}$. It is more query-efficient than $\textbf{SimBA}$, a simple and powerful baseline black-box attack, and has a similar level of complexity. Therefore, we propose it both as a new strong baseline for black-box adversarial attacks and as a fast and general tool for gaining empirical insight into how robust image classifiers are with respect to $L_0$ adversarial perturbations.   There exist fast and reliable $L_2$ black-box attacks, such as $\textbf{SimBA}$, and $L_{\infty}$ black-box attacks, such as $\textbf{DeepSearch}$. We propose $\textbf{EvoBA}$ as a query-efficient $L_0$ black-box adversarial attack which, together with the aforementioned methods, can serve as a generic tool to assess the empirical robustness of image classifiers. The main advantages of such methods are that they run fast, are query-efficient, and can easily be integrated in image classifiers development pipelines.   While our attack minimises the $L_0$ adversarial perturbation, we also report $L_2$, and notice that we compare favorably to the state-of-the-art $L_2$ black-box attack, $\textbf{AutoZOOM}$, and of the $L_2$ strong baseline, $\textbf{SimBA}$. </description>

      <title>Detect and Defense Against Adversarial Examples in Deep Learning using Natural Scene Statistics and Adaptive Denoising. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05780</link>
      <description>  Despite the enormous performance of deepneural networks (DNNs), recent studies have shown theirvulnerability to adversarial examples (AEs), i.e., care-fully perturbed inputs designed to fool the targetedDNN. Currently, the literature is rich with many ef-fective attacks to craft such AEs. Meanwhile, many de-fenses strategies have been developed to mitigate thisvulnerability. However, these latter showed their effec-tiveness against specific attacks and does not general-ize well to different attacks. In this paper, we proposea framework for defending DNN classifier against ad-versarial samples. The proposed method is based on atwo-stage framework involving a separate detector anda denoising block. The detector aims to detect AEs bycharacterizing them through the use of natural scenestatistic (NSS), where we demonstrate that these statis-tical features are altered by the presence of adversarialperturbations. The denoiser is based on block matching3D (BM3D) filter fed by an optimum threshold valueestimated by a convolutional neural network (CNN) toproject back the samples detected as AEs into theirdata manifold. We conducted a complete evaluation onthree standard datasets namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 andTiny-ImageNet. The experimental results show that theproposed defense method outperforms the state-of-the-art defense techniques by improving the robustnessagainst a set of attacks under black-box, gray-box and white-box settings.

      <title>Perceptual-based deep-learning denoiser as a defense against adversarial attacks on ASR systems. (96%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05222</link>
      <description>  In this paper we investigate speech denoising as a defense against adversarial attacks on automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Adversarial attacks attempt to force misclassification by adding small perturbations to the original speech signal. We propose to counteract this by employing a neural-network based denoiser as a pre-processor in the ASR pipeline. The denoiser is independent of the downstream ASR model, and thus can be rapidly deployed in existing systems. We found that training the denoisier using a perceptually motivated loss function resulted in increased adversarial robustness without compromising ASR performance on benign samples. Our defense was evaluated (as a part of the DARPA GARD program) on the 'Kenansville' attack strategy across a range of attack strengths and speech samples. An average improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) of about 7.7% was observed over the undefended model at 20 dB signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) attack strength. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05243</link>
      <description>  Neural machine translation systems are known to be vulnerable to adversarial test inputs, however, as we show in this paper, these systems are also vulnerable to training attacks. Specifically, we propose a poisoning attack in which a malicious adversary inserts a small poisoned sample of monolingual text into the training set of a system trained using back-translation. This sample is designed to induce a specific, targeted translation behaviour, such as peddling misinformation. We present two methods for crafting poisoned examples, and show that only a tiny handful of instances, amounting to only 0.02% of the training set, is sufficient to enact a successful attack. We outline a defence method against said attacks, which partly ameliorates the problem. However, we stress that this is a blind-spot in modern NMT, demanding immediate attention. </description>

Our evaluation under a diverse range of white-box $l_{\infty}$ attacks suggests that information bottlenecks alone are not a strong defense strategy, and that previous results were likely influenced by gradient obfuscation. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05747</link>
      <description>  State-of-the-art artificial neural networks (ANNs) require labelled data or feedback between layers, are often biologically implausible, and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that humans are not susceptible to. On the other hand, Hebbian learning in winner-take-all (WTA) networks, is unsupervised, feed-forward, and biologically plausible. However, an objective optimization theory for WTA networks has been missing, except under very limiting assumptions. Here we derive formally such a theory, based on biologically plausible but generic ANN elements. Through Hebbian learning, network parameters maintain a Bayesian generative model of the data. There is no supervisory loss function, but the network does minimize cross-entropy between its activations and the input distribution. The key is a &quot;soft&quot; WTA where there is no absolute &quot;hard&quot; winner neuron, and a specific type of Hebbian-like plasticity of weights and biases. We confirm our theory in practice, where, in handwritten digit (MNIST) recognition, our Hebbian algorithm, SoftHebb, minimizes cross-entropy without having access to it, and outperforms the more frequently used, hard-WTA-based method. Strikingly, it even outperforms supervised end-to-end backpropagation, under certain conditions. Specifically, in a two-layered network, SoftHebb outperforms backpropagation when the training dataset is only presented once, when the testing data is noisy, and under gradient-based adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks that confuse SoftHebb are also confusing to the human eye. Finally, the model can generate interpolations of objects from its input distribution. </description>

      <title>Adversarial for Good? How the Adversarial ML Community's Values Impede Socially Beneficial Uses of Attacks. (76%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10302</link>
      <description>  Attacks from adversarial machine learning (ML) have the potential to be used &quot;for good&quot;: they can be used to run counter to the existing power structures within ML, creating breathing space for those who would otherwise be the targets of surveillance and control. But most research on adversarial ML has not engaged in developing tools for resistance against ML systems. Why? In this paper, we review the broader impact statements that adversarial ML researchers wrote as part of their NeurIPS 2020 papers and assess the assumptions that authors have about the goals of their work. We also collect information about how authors view their work's impact more generally. We find that most adversarial ML researchers at NeurIPS hold two fundamental assumptions that will make it difficult for them to consider socially beneficial uses of attacks: (1) it is desirable to make systems robust, independent of context, and (2) attackers of systems are normatively bad and defenders of systems are normatively good. That is, despite their expressed and supposed neutrality, most adversarial ML researchers believe that the goal of their work is to secure systems, making it difficult to conceptualize and build tools for disrupting the status quo. </description>

      <title>Stateful Detection of Model Extraction Attacks. (2%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05166</link>
      <description>  Machine-Learning-as-a-Service providers expose machine learning (ML) models through application programming interfaces (APIs) to developers. Recent work has shown that attackers can exploit these APIs to extract good approximations of such ML models, by querying them with samples of their choosing. We propose VarDetect, a stateful monitor that tracks the distribution of queries made by users of such a service, to detect model extraction attacks. Harnessing the latent distributions learned by a modified variational autoencoder, VarDetect robustly separates three types of attacker samples from benign samples, and successfully raises an alarm for each. Further, with VarDetect deployed as an automated defense mechanism, the extracted substitute models are found to exhibit poor performance and transferability, as intended. Finally, we demonstrate that even adaptive attackers with prior knowledge of the deployment of VarDetect, are detected by it. </description>

      <description>  Adversarial learning is used to test the robustness of machine learning algorithms under attack and create attacks that deceive the anomaly detection methods in Industrial Control System (ICS). Given that security assessment of an ICS demands that an exhaustive set of possible attack patterns is studied, in this work, we propose an association rule mining-based attack generation technique. The technique has been implemented using data from a secure Water Treatment plant. The proposed technique was able to generate more than 300,000 attack patterns constituting a vast majority of new attack vectors which were not seen before. Automatically generated attacks improve our understanding of the potential attacks and enable the design of robust attack detection techniques. </description>

      <title>Hack The Box: Fooling Deep Learning Abstraction-Based Monitors. (91%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04764</link>
      <description>  Deep learning is a type of machine learning that adapts a deep hierarchy of concepts. Deep learning classifiers link the most basic version of concepts at the input layer to the most abstract version of concepts at the output layer, also known as a class or label. However, once trained over a finite set of classes, some deep learning models do not have the power to say that a given input does not belong to any of the classes and simply cannot be linked. Correctly invalidating the prediction of unrelated classes is a challenging problem that has been tackled in many ways in the literature. Novelty detection gives deep learning the ability to output &quot;do not know&quot; for novel/unseen classes. Still, no attention has been given to the security aspects of novelty detection. In this paper, we consider the case study of abstraction-based novelty detection and show that it is not robust against adversarial samples. Moreover, we show the feasibility of crafting adversarial samples that fool the deep learning classifier and bypass the novelty detection monitoring at the same time. In other words, these monitoring boxes are hackable. We demonstrate that novelty detection itself ends up as an attack surface. </description>

      <title>Identifying Layers Susceptible to Adversarial Attacks. (83%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04827</link>
      <description>  Common neural network architectures are susceptible to attack by adversarial samples. Neural network architectures are commonly thought of as divided into low-level feature extraction layers and high-level classification layers; susceptibility of networks to adversarial samples is often thought of as a problem related to classification rather than feature extraction. We test this idea by selectively retraining different portions of VGG and ResNet architectures on CIFAR-10, Imagenette and ImageNet using non-adversarial and adversarial data. Our experimental results show that susceptibility to adversarial samples is associated with low-level feature extraction layers. Therefore, retraining high-level layers is insufficient for achieving robustness. This phenomenon could have two explanations: either, adversarial attacks yield outputs from early layers that are indistinguishable from features found in the attack classes, or adversarial attacks yield outputs from early layers that differ statistically from features for non-adversarial samples and do not permit consistent classification by subsequent layers. We test this question by large-scale non-linear dimensionality reduction and density modeling on distributions of feature vectors in hidden layers and find that the feature distributions between non-adversarial and adversarial samples differ substantially. Our results provide new insights into the statistical origins of adversarial samples and possible defenses. </description>

      <title>HOMRS: High Order Metamorphic Relations Selector for Deep Neural Networks. (81%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04863</link>
      <description>  Deep Neural Networks (DNN) applications are increasingly becoming a part of our everyday life, from medical applications to autonomous cars. Traditional validation of DNN relies on accuracy measures, however, the existence of adversarial examples has highlighted the limitations of these accuracy measures, raising concerns especially when DNN are integrated into safety-critical systems. In this paper, we present HOMRS, an approach to boost metamorphic testing by automatically building a small optimized set of high order metamorphic relations from an initial set of elementary metamorphic relations. HOMRS' backbone is a multi-objective search; it exploits ideas drawn from traditional systems testing such as code coverage, test case, and path diversity. We applied HOMRS to LeNet5 DNN with MNIST dataset and we report evidence that it builds a small but effective set of high order transformations achieving a 95% kill ratio. Five raters manually labeled a pool of images before and after high order transformation; Fleiss' Kappa and statistical tests confirmed that they are metamorphic properties. HOMRS built-in relations are also effective to confront adversarial or out-of-distribution examples; HOMRS detected 92% of randomly sampled out-of-distribution images. HOMRS transformations are also suitable for online real-time use. </description>

      <title>Out of Distribution Detection and Adversarial Attacks on Deep Neural Networks for Robust Medical Image Analysis. (22%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04882</link>
      <description>  Deep learning models have become a popular choice for medical image analysis. However, the poor generalization performance of deep learning models limits them from being deployed in the real world as robustness is critical for medical applications. For instance, the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) fail to detect adversarial samples or samples drawn statistically far away from the training distribution. In this work, we experimentally evaluate the robustness of a Mahalanobis distance-based confidence score, a simple yet effective method for detecting abnormal input samples, in classifying malaria parasitized cells and uninfected cells. Results indicated that the Mahalanobis confidence score detector exhibits improved performance and robustness of deep learning models, and achieves stateof-the-art performance on both out-of-distribution (OOD) and adversarial samples. </description>

      <title>Cyber-Security Challenges in Aviation Industry: A Review of Current and Future Trends. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04910</link>
      <description>  The integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools into mechanical devices found in aviation industry has raised security concerns. The more integrated the system, the more vulnerable due to the inherent vulnerabilities found in ICT tools and software that drives the system. The security concerns have become more heightened as the concept of electronic-enabled aircraft and smart airports get refined and implemented underway. In line with the above, this paper undertakes a review of cyber-security incidence in the aviation sector over the last 20 years. The essence is to understand the common threat actors, their motivations, the type of attacks, aviation infrastructure that is commonly attacked and then match these so as to provide insight on the current state of the cyber-security in the aviation sector. The review showed that the industry's threats come mainly from Advance Persistent Threat (APT) groups that work in collaboration with some state actors to steal intellectual property and intelligence, in order to advance their domestic aerospace capabilities as well as possibly monitor, infiltrate and subvert other nations' capabilities. The segment of the aviation industry commonly attacked is the Information Technology infrastructure, and the prominent type of attacks is malicious hacking activities that aim at gaining unauthorised access using known malicious password cracking techniques such as Brute force attacks, Dictionary attacks and so on. The review further analysed the different attack surfaces that exist in aviation industry, threat dynamics, and use these dynamics to predict future trends of cyberattacks in the industry. The aim is to provide information for the cybersecurity professionals and aviation stakeholders for proactive actions in protecting these critical infrastructures against cyberincidence for an optimal customer service oriented industry. </description>

      <title>Universal 3-Dimensional Perturbations for Black-Box Attacks on Video Recognition Systems. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04284</link>
      <description>  Widely deployed deep neural network (DNN) models have been proven to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in many applications (e.g., image, audio and text classifications). To date, there are only a few adversarial perturbations proposed to deviate the DNN models in video recognition systems by simply injecting 2D perturbations into video frames. However, such attacks may overly perturb the videos without learning the spatio-temporal features (across temporal frames), which are commonly extracted by DNN models for video recognition. To our best knowledge, we propose the first black-box attack framework that generates universal 3-dimensional (U3D) perturbations to subvert a variety of video recognition systems. U3D has many advantages, such as (1) as the transfer-based attack, U3D can universally attack multiple DNN models for video recognition without accessing to the target DNN model; (2) the high transferability of U3D makes such universal black-box attack easy-to-launch, which can be further enhanced by integrating queries over the target model when necessary; (3) U3D ensures human-imperceptibility; (4) U3D can bypass the existing state-of-the-art defense schemes; (5) U3D can be efficiently generated with a few pre-learned parameters, and then immediately injected to attack real-time DNN-based video recognition systems. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate U3D on multiple DNN models and three large-scale video datasets. The experimental results demonstrate its superiority and practicality. </description>

      <title>Learning to Detect Adversarial Examples Based on Class Scores. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04435</link>
      <description>  Given the increasing threat of adversarial attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs), research on efficient detection methods is more important than ever. In this work, we take a closer look at adversarial attack detection based on the class scores of an already trained classification model. We propose to train a support vector machine (SVM) on the class scores to detect adversarial examples. Our method is able to detect adversarial examples generated by various attacks, and can be easily adopted to a plethora of deep classification models. We show that our approach yields an improved detection rate compared to an existing method, whilst being easy to implement. We perform an extensive empirical analysis on different deep classification models, investigating various state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. Moreover, we observe that our proposed method is better at detecting a combination of adversarial attacks. This work indicates the potential of detecting various adversarial attacks simply by using the class scores of an already trained classification model. </description>

      <title>Resilience of Autonomous Vehicle Object Category Detection to Universal Adversarial Perturbations. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04749</link>
      <description>  Due to the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, numerous works on adversarial attacks and defenses have been burgeoning over the past several years. However, there seem to be some conventional views regarding adversarial attacks and object detection approaches that most researchers take for granted. In this work, we bring a fresh perspective on those procedures by evaluating the impact of universal perturbations on object detection at a class-level. We apply it to a carefully curated data set related to autonomous driving. We use Faster-RCNN object detector on images of five different categories: person, car, truck, stop sign and traffic light from the COCO data set, while carefully perturbing the images using Universal Dense Object Suppression algorithm. Our results indicate that person, car, traffic light, truck and stop sign are resilient in that order (most to least) to universal perturbations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a ranking has been established which is significant for the security of the data sets pertaining to autonomous vehicles and object detection in general. </description>

      <title>GGT: Graph-Guided Testing for Adversarial Sample Detection of Deep Neural Network. (98%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07043</link>
      <description>  Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial samples, the detection of which is crucial for the wide application of these DNN models. Recently, a number of deep testing methods in software engineering were proposed to find the vulnerability of DNN systems, and one of them, i.e., Model Mutation Testing (MMT), was used to successfully detect various adversarial samples generated by different kinds of adversarial attacks. However, the mutated models in MMT are always huge in number (e.g., over 100 models) and lack diversity (e.g., can be easily circumvented by high-confidence adversarial samples), which makes it less efficient in real applications and less effective in detecting high-confidence adversarial samples. In this study, we propose Graph-Guided Testing (GGT) for adversarial sample detection to overcome these aforementioned challenges. GGT generates pruned models with the guide of graph characteristics, each of them has only about 5% parameters of the mutated model in MMT, and graph guided models have higher diversity. The experiments on CIFAR10 and SVHN validate that GGT performs much better than MMT with respect to both effectiveness and efficiency. </description>

      <title>Towards Robust General Medical Image Segmentation. (83%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04263</link>
      <description>  The reliability of Deep Learning systems depends on their accuracy but also on their robustness against adversarial perturbations to the input data. Several attacks and defenses have been proposed to improve the performance of Deep Neural Networks under the presence of adversarial noise in the natural image domain. However, robustness in computer-aided diagnosis for volumetric data has only been explored for specific tasks and with limited attacks. We propose a new framework to assess the robustness of general medical image segmentation systems. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) we propose a new benchmark to evaluate robustness in the context of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) by extending the recent AutoAttack natural image classification framework to the domain of volumetric data segmentation, and (ii) we present a novel lattice architecture for RObust Generic medical image segmentation (ROG). Our results show that ROG is capable of generalizing across different tasks of the MSD and largely surpasses the state-of-the-art under sophisticated adversarial attacks. </description>

      <title>ARC: Adversarially Robust Control Policies for Autonomous Vehicles. (38%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04487</link>
      <description>  Deep neural networks have demonstrated their capability to learn control policies for a variety of tasks. However, these neural network-based policies have been shown to be susceptible to exploitation by adversarial agents. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques to learn control policies that are robust against adversaries. We introduce Adversarially Robust Control (ARC), which trains the protagonist policy and the adversarial policy end-to-end on the same loss. The aim of the protagonist is to maximise this loss, whilst the adversary is attempting to minimise it. We demonstrate the proposed ARC training in a highway driving scenario, where the protagonist controls the follower vehicle whilst the adversary controls the lead vehicle. By training the protagonist against an ensemble of adversaries, it learns a significantly more robust control policy, which generalises to a variety of adversarial strategies. The approach is shown to reduce the amount of collisions against new adversaries by up to 90.25%, compared to the original policy. Moreover, by utilising an auxiliary distillation loss, we show that the fine-tuned control policy shows no drop in performance across its original training distribution. </description>

      <title>Output Randomization: A Novel Defense for both White-box and Black-box Adversarial Models. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03806</link>
      <description>  Adversarial examples pose a threat to deep neural network models in a variety of scenarios, from settings where the adversary has complete knowledge of the model in a &quot;white box&quot; setting and to the opposite in a &quot;black box&quot; setting. In this paper, we explore the use of output randomization as a defense against attacks in both the black box and white box models and propose two defenses. In the first defense, we propose output randomization at test time to thwart finite difference attacks in black box settings. Since this type of attack relies on repeated queries to the model to estimate gradients, we investigate the use of randomization to thwart such adversaries from successfully creating adversarial examples. We empirically show that this defense can limit the success rate of a black box adversary using the Zeroth Order Optimization attack to 0%. Secondly, we propose output randomization training as a defense against white box adversaries. Unlike prior approaches that use randomization, our defense does not require its use at test time, eliminating the Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation attack, which was shown to be effective against other randomization defenses. Additionally, this defense has low overhead and is easily implemented, allowing it to be used together with other defenses across various model architectures. We evaluate output randomization training against the Projected Gradient Descent attacker and show that the defense can reduce the PGD attack's success rate down to 12% when using cross-entropy loss. </description>

      <title>Improving Model Robustness with Latent Distribution Locally and Globally. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04401</link>
      <description>  In this work, we consider model robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks from a global manifold perspective. Leveraging both the local and global latent information, we propose a novel adversarial training method through robust optimization, and a tractable way to generate Latent Manifold Adversarial Examples (LMAEs) via an adversarial game between a discriminator and a classifier. The proposed adversarial training with latent distribution (ATLD) method defends against adversarial attacks by crafting LMAEs with the latent manifold in an unsupervised manner. ATLD preserves the local and global information of latent manifold and promises improved robustness against adversarial attacks. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments over different datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN) with different adversarial attacks (e.g., PGD, CW), and show that our method substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art (e.g., Feature Scattering) in adversarial robustness by a large accuracy margin.

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03759</link>
      <description>  With few exceptions, neural networks have been relying on backpropagation and gradient descent as the inference engine in order to learn the model parameters, because the closed-form Bayesian inference for neural networks has been considered to be intractable. In this paper, we show how we can leverage the tractable approximate Gaussian inference's (TAGI) capabilities to infer hidden states, rather than only using it for inferring the network's parameters. One novel aspect it allows is to infer hidden states through the imposition of constraints designed to achieve specific objectives, as illustrated through three examples: (1) the generation of adversarial-attack examples, (2) the usage of a neural network as a black-box optimization method, and (3) the application of inference on continuous-action reinforcement learning. These applications showcase how tasks that were previously reserved to gradient-based optimization approaches can now be approached with analytically tractable inference </description>

      <title>Understanding the Limits of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Data Poisoning. (31%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03919</link>
      <description>  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables cross-domain learning without target domain labels by transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain whose distribution differs from the target. However, UDA is not always successful and several accounts of &quot;negative transfer&quot; have been reported in the literature. In this work, we prove a simple lower bound on the target domain error that complements the existing upper bound. Our bound shows the insufficiency of minimizing source domain error and marginal distribution mismatch for a guaranteed reduction in the target domain error, due to the possible increase of induced labeling function mismatch. This insufficiency is further illustrated through simple distributions for which the same UDA approach succeeds, fails, and may succeed or fail with an equal chance. Motivated from this, we propose novel data poisoning attacks to fool UDA methods into learning representations that produce large target domain errors. We evaluate the effect of these attacks on popular UDA methods using benchmark datasets where they have been previously shown to be successful. Our results show that poisoning can significantly decrease the target domain accuracy, dropping it to almost 0\% in some cases, with the addition of only 10\% poisoned data in the source domain. The failure of UDA methods demonstrates the limitations of UDA at guaranteeing cross-domain generalization consistent with the lower bound. Thus, evaluation of UDA methods in adversarial settings such as data poisoning can provide a better sense of their robustness in scenarios unfavorable for UDA. </description>

      <title>Controlled Caption Generation for Images Through Adversarial Attacks. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03050</link>
      <description>  Deep learning is found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, its adversarial susceptibility in image caption generation is under-explored. We study adversarial examples for vision and language models, which typically adopt an encoder-decoder framework consisting of two major components: a Convolutional Neural Network (i.e., CNN) for image feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for caption generation. In particular, we investigate attacks on the visual encoder's hidden layer that is fed to the subsequent recurrent network. The existing methods either attack the classification layer of the visual encoder or they back-propagate the gradients from the language model. In contrast, we propose a GAN-based algorithm for crafting adversarial examples for neural image captioning that mimics the internal representation of the CNN such that the resulting deep features of the input image enable a controlled incorrect caption generation through the recurrent network. Our contribution provides new insights for understanding adversarial attacks on vision systems with language component. The proposed method employs two strategies for a comprehensive evaluation. The first examines if a neural image captioning system can be misled to output targeted image captions. The second analyzes the possibility of keywords into the predicted captions. Experiments show that our algorithm can craft effective adversarial images based on the CNN hidden layers to fool captioning framework. Moreover, we discover the proposed attack to be highly transferable. Our work leads to new robustness implications for neural image captioning. </description>

      <title>Incorporating Label Uncertainty in Understanding Adversarial Robustness. (38%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03250</link>
      <description>  A fundamental question in adversarial machine learning is whether a robust classifier exists for a given task. A line of research has made progress towards this goal by studying concentration of measure, but without considering data labels. We argue that the standard concentration fails to fully characterize the intrinsic robustness of a classification problem, since it ignores data labels which are essential to any classification task. Building on a novel definition of label uncertainty, we empirically demonstrate that error regions induced by state-of-the-art models tend to have much higher label uncertainty compared with randomly-selected subsets. This observation motivates us to adapt a concentration estimation algorithm to account for label uncertainty, resulting in more accurate intrinsic robustness measures for benchmark image classification problems. We further provide empirical evidence showing that adding an abstain option for classifiers based on label uncertainty can help improve both the clean and robust accuracies of models. </description>

      <title>RoFL: Attestable Robustness for Secure Federated Learning. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03311</link>
      <description>  Federated Learning is an emerging decentralized machine learning paradigm that allows a large number of clients to train a joint model without the need to share their private data. Participants instead only share ephemeral updates necessary to train the model. To ensure the confidentiality of the client updates, Federated Learning systems employ secure aggregation; clients encrypt their gradient updates, and only the aggregated model is revealed to the server. Achieving this level of data protection, however, presents new challenges to the robustness of Federated Learning, i.e., the ability to tolerate failures and attacks. Unfortunately, in this setting, a malicious client can now easily exert influence on the model behavior without being detected. As Federated Learning is being deployed in practice in a range of sensitive applications, its robustness is growing in importance. In this paper, we take a step towards understanding and improving the robustness of secure Federated Learning. We start this paper with a systematic study that evaluates and analyzes existing attack vectors and discusses potential defenses and assesses their effectiveness. We then present RoFL, a secure Federated Learning system that improves robustness against malicious clients through input checks on the encrypted model updates. RoFL extends Federated Learning's secure aggregation protocol to allow expressing a variety of properties and constraints on model updates using zero-knowledge proofs. To enable RoFL to scale to typical Federated Learning settings, we introduce several ML and cryptographic optimizations specific to Federated Learning. We implement and evaluate a prototype of RoFL and show that realistic ML models can be trained in a reasonable time while improving robustness. </description>

      <title>GradDiv: Adversarial Robustness of Randomized Neural Networks via Gradient Diversity Regularization. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02425</link>
      <description>  Deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial examples. Many defenses based on randomized neural networks have been proposed to solve the problem, but fail to achieve robustness against attacks using proxy gradients such as the Expectation over Transformation (EOT) attack. We investigate the effect of the adversarial attacks using proxy gradients on randomized neural networks and demonstrate that it highly relies on the directional distribution of the loss gradients of the randomized neural network. We show in particular that proxy gradients are less effective when the gradients are more scattered. To this end, we propose Gradient Diversity (GradDiv) regularizations that minimize the concentration of the gradients to build a robust randomized neural network. Our experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and STL10 show that our proposed GradDiv regularizations improve the adversarial robustness of randomized neural networks against a variety of state-of-the-art attack methods. Moreover, our method efficiently reduces the transferability among sample models of randomized neural networks. </description>

      <description>  Image editing techniques enable people to modify the content of an image without leaving visual traces and thus may cause serious security risks. Hence the detection and localization of these forgeries become quite necessary and challenging. Furthermore, unlike other tasks with extensive data, there is usually a lack of annotated forged images for training due to annotation difficulties. In this paper, we propose a self-adversarial training strategy and a reliable coarse-to-fine network that utilizes a self-attention mechanism to localize forged regions in forgery images. The self-attention module is based on a Channel-Wise High Pass Filter block (CW-HPF). CW-HPF leverages inter-channel relationships of features and extracts noise features by high pass filters. Based on the CW-HPF, a self-attention mechanism, called forgery attention, is proposed to capture rich contextual dependencies of intrinsic inconsistency extracted from tampered regions. Specifically, we append two types of attention modules on top of CW-HPF respectively to model internal interdependencies in spatial dimension and external dependencies among channels. We exploit a coarse-to-fine network to enhance the noise inconsistency between original and tampered regions. More importantly, to address the issue of insufficient training data, we design a self-adversarial training strategy that expands training data dynamically to achieve more robust performance. Specifically, in each training iteration, we perform adversarial attacks against our network to generate adversarial examples and train our model on them. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm steadily outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin in different benchmark datasets. </description>

      <title>On Generalization of Graph Autoencoders with Adversarial Training. (12%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02658</link>
      <description>  Adversarial training is an approach for increasing model's resilience against adversarial perturbations. Such approaches have been demonstrated to result in models with feature representations that generalize better. However, limited works have been done on adversarial training of models on graph data. In this paper, we raise such a question { does adversarial training improve the generalization of graph representations. We formulate L2 and L1 versions of adversarial training in two powerful node embedding methods: graph autoencoder (GAE) and variational graph autoencoder (VGAE). We conduct extensive experiments on three main applications, i.e. link prediction, node clustering, graph anomaly detection of GAE and VGAE, and demonstrate that both L2 and L1 adversarial training boost the generalization of GAE and VGAE. </description>

      <title>On Robustness of Lane Detection Models to Physical-World Adversarial Attacks in Autonomous Driving. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02488</link>
      <description>  After the 2017 TuSimple Lane Detection Challenge, its evaluation based on accuracy and F1 score has become the de facto standard to measure the performance of lane detection methods. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study to evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art lane detection methods under physical-world adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. We evaluate 4 major types of lane detection approaches with the conventional evaluation and end-to-end evaluation in autonomous driving scenarios and then discuss the security proprieties of each lane detection model. We demonstrate that the conventional evaluation fails to reflect the robustness in end-to-end autonomous driving scenarios. Our results show that the most robust model on the conventional metrics is the least robust in the end-to-end evaluation. Although the competition dataset and its metrics have played a substantial role in developing performant lane detection methods along with the rapid development of deep neural networks, the conventional evaluation is becoming obsolete and the gap between the metrics and practicality is critical. We hope that our study will help the community make further progress in building a more comprehensive framework to evaluate lane detection models. </description>

      <title>When and How to Fool Explainable Models (and Humans) with Adversarial Examples. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01943</link>
      <description>  Reliable deployment of machine learning models such as neural networks continues to be challenging due to several limitations. Some of the main shortcomings are the lack of interpretability and the lack of robustness against adversarial examples or out-of-distribution inputs. In this paper, we explore the possibilities and limits of adversarial attacks for explainable machine learning models. First, we extend the notion of adversarial examples to fit in explainable machine learning scenarios, in which the inputs, the output classifications and the explanations of the model's decisions are assessed by humans. Next, we propose a comprehensive framework to study whether (and how) adversarial examples can be generated for explainable models under human assessment, introducing novel attack paradigms. In particular, our framework considers a wide range of relevant (yet often ignored) factors such as the type of problem, the user expertise or the objective of the explanations in order to identify the attack strategies that should be adopted in each scenario to successfully deceive the model (and the human). These contributions intend to serve as a basis for a more rigorous and realistic study of adversarial examples in the field of explainable machine learning. </description>

      <title>Boosting Transferability of Targeted Adversarial Examples via Hierarchical Generative Networks. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01809</link>
      <description>  Transfer-based adversarial attacks can effectively evaluate model robustness in the black-box setting. Though several methods have demonstrated impressive transferability of untargeted adversarial examples, targeted adversarial transferability is still challenging. The existing methods either have low targeted transferability or sacrifice computational efficiency. In this paper, we develop a simple yet practical framework to efficiently craft targeted transfer-based adversarial examples. Specifically, we propose a conditional generative attacking model, which can generate the adversarial examples targeted at different classes by simply altering the class embedding and share a single backbone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves the success rates of targeted black-box attacks by a significant margin over the existing methods -- it reaches an average success rate of 29.6\% against six diverse models based only on one substitute white-box model in the standard testing of NeurIPS 2017 competition, which outperforms the state-of-the-art gradient-based attack methods (with an average success rate of $&lt;$2\%) by a large margin. Moreover, the proposed method is also more efficient beyond an order of magnitude than gradient-based methods. </description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness of Probabilistic Network Embedding for Link Prediction. (87%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01936</link>
      <description>  In today's networked society, many real-world problems can be formalized as predicting links in networks, such as Facebook friendship suggestions, e-commerce recommendations, and the prediction of scientific collaborations in citation networks. Increasingly often, link prediction problem is tackled by means of network embedding methods, owing to their state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods lack transparency when compared to simpler baselines, and as a result their robustness against adversarial attacks is a possible point of concern: could one or a few small adversarial modifications to the network have a large impact on the link prediction performance when using a network embedding model? Prior research has already investigated adversarial robustness for network embedding models, focused on classification at the node and graph level. Robustness with respect to the link prediction downstream task, on the other hand, has been explored much less.   This paper contributes to filling this gap, by studying adversarial robustness of Conditional Network Embedding (CNE), a state-of-the-art probabilistic network embedding model, for link prediction. More specifically, given CNE and a network, we measure the sensitivity of the link predictions of the model to small adversarial perturbations of the network, namely changes of the link status of a node pair. Thus, our approach allows one to identify the links and non-links in the network that are most vulnerable to such perturbations, for further investigation by an analyst. We analyze the characteristics of the most and least sensitive perturbations, and empirically confirm that our approach not only succeeds in identifying the most vulnerable links and non-links, but also that it does so in a time-efficient manner thanks to an effective approximation. </description>

      <title>Dealing with Adversarial Player Strategies in the Neural Network Game iNNk through Ensemble Learning. (69%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02052</link>
      <description>  Applying neural network (NN) methods in games can lead to various new and exciting game dynamics not previously possible. However, they also lead to new challenges such as the lack of large, clean datasets, varying player skill levels, and changing gameplay strategies. In this paper, we focus on the adversarial player strategy aspect in the game iNNk, in which players try to communicate secret code words through drawings with the goal of not being deciphered by a NN. Some strategies exploit weaknesses in the NN that consistently trick it into making incorrect classifications, leading to unbalanced gameplay. We present a method that combines transfer learning and ensemble methods to obtain a data-efficient adaptation to these strategies. This combination significantly outperforms the baseline NN across all adversarial player strategies despite only being trained on a limited set of adversarial examples. We expect the methods developed in this paper to be useful for the rapidly growing field of NN-based games, which will require new approaches to deal with unforeseen player creativity. </description>

      <title>Understanding the Security of Deepfake Detection. (33%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02045</link>
      <description>  Deepfakes pose growing challenges to the trust of information on the Internet. Therefore,detecting deepfakes has attracted increasing attentions from both academia and industry. State-of-the-art deepfake detection methods consist of two key components, i.e., face extractor and face classifier, which extract the face region in an image and classify it to be real/fake, respectively. Existing studies mainly focused on improving the detection performance in non-adversarial settings, leaving security of deepfake detection in adversarial settings largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap. In particular, we perform a systematic measurement study to understand the security of the state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods in adversarial settings. We use two large-scale public deepfakes data sources including FaceForensics++ and Facebook Deepfake Detection Challenge, where the deepfakes are fake face images; and we train state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods. These detection methods can achieve 0.94--0.99 accuracies in non-adversarial settings on these datasets. However, our measurement results uncover multiple security limitations of the deepfake detection methods in adversarial settings. First, we find that an attacker can evade a face extractor, i.e., the face extractor fails to extract the correct face regions, via adding small Gaussian noise to its deepfake images. Second, we find that a face classifier trained using deepfakes generated by one method cannot detect deepfakes generated by another method, i.e., an attacker can evade detection via generating deepfakes using a new method. Third, we find that an attacker can leverage backdoor attacks developed by the adversarial machine learning community to evade a face classifier. Our results highlight that deepfake detection should consider the adversarial nature of the problem. </description>

      <title>Poisoning Attack against Estimating from Pairwise Comparisons. (15%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01854</link>
      <description>  As pairwise ranking becomes broadly employed for elections, sports competitions, recommendations, and so on, attackers have strong motivation and incentives to manipulate the ranking list. They could inject malicious comparisons into the training data to fool the victim. Such a technique is called poisoning attack in regression and classification tasks. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we initiate the first systematic investigation of data poisoning attacks on pairwise ranking algorithms, which can be formalized as the dynamic and static games between the ranker and the attacker and can be modeled as certain kinds of integer programming problems. To break the computational hurdle of the underlying integer programming problems, we reformulate them into the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems, which are computationally tractable. Based on such DRO formulations, we propose two efficient poisoning attack algorithms and establish the associated theoretical guarantees. The effectiveness of the suggested poisoning attack strategies is demonstrated by a series of toy simulations and several real data experiments. These experimental results show that the proposed methods can significantly reduce the performance of the ranker in the sense that the correlation between the true ranking list and the aggregated results can be decreased dramatically. </description>

      <title>Confidence Conditioned Knowledge Distillation. (10%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06993</link>
      <description>  In this paper, a novel confidence conditioned knowledge distillation (CCKD) scheme for transferring the knowledge from a teacher model to a student model is proposed. Existing state-of-the-art methods employ fixed loss functions for this purpose and ignore the different levels of information that need to be transferred for different samples. In addition to that, these methods are also inefficient in terms of data usage. CCKD addresses these issues by leveraging the confidence assigned by the teacher model to the correct class to devise sample-specific loss functions (CCKD-L formulation) and targets (CCKD-T formulation). Further, CCKD improves the data efficiency by employing self-regulation to stop those samples from participating in the distillation process on which the student model learns faster. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets show that CCKD methods achieve at least as much generalization performance levels as other state-of-the-art methods while being data efficient in the process. Student models trained through CCKD methods do not retain most of the misclassifications commited by the teacher model on the training set. Distillation through CCKD methods improves the resilience of the student models against adversarial attacks compared to the conventional KD method. Experiments show at least 3% increase in performance against adversarial attacks for the MNIST and the Fashion MNIST datasets, and at least 6% increase for the CIFAR10 dataset. </description>

      <title>Certifiably Robust Interpretation via Renyi Differential Privacy. (67%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01561</link>
      <description>  Motivated by the recent discovery that the interpretation maps of CNNs could easily be manipulated by adversarial attacks against network interpretability, we study the problem of interpretation robustness from a new perspective of \Renyi differential privacy (RDP). The advantages of our Renyi-Robust-Smooth (RDP-based interpretation method) are three-folds. First, it can offer provable and certifiable top-$k$ robustness. That is, the top-$k$ important attributions of the interpretation map are provably robust under any input perturbation with bounded $\ell_d$-norm (for any $d\geq 1$, including $d = \infty$). Second, our proposed method offers $\sim10\%$ better experimental robustness than existing approaches in terms of the top-$k$ attributions. Remarkably, the accuracy of Renyi-Robust-Smooth also outperforms existing approaches. Third, our method can provide a smooth tradeoff between robustness and computational efficiency. Experimentally, its top-$k$ attributions are {\em twice} more robust than existing approaches when the computational resources are highly constrained. </description>

      <title>Mirror Mirror on the Wall: Next-Generation Wireless Jamming Attacks Based on Software-Controlled Surfaces. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01709</link>
      <description>  The intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new paradigm in wireless communications to meet the growing demand for high-speed connectivity in next-generation mobile networks. IRS, also known as software-controlled metasurfaces, consist of an array of adjustable radio wave reflectors, enabling smart radio environments, e.g., for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial diversity of wireless channels.   Research on IRS to date has been largely focused on constructive applications. In this work, we show for the first time that the IRS provides a practical low-cost toolkit for attackers to easily perform complex signal manipulation attacks on the physical layer in real time. We introduce the environment reconfiguration attack (ERA) as a novel class of jamming attacks in wireless radio networks. Here, an adversary leverages an IRS to rapidly vary the electromagnetic propagation environment to disturb legitimate receivers. The IRS gives the adversary a key advantage over traditional jamming: It no longer has to actively emit a jamming signal itself while the jamming signal is correlated to the legitimate communication signal.   We thoroughly investigate the ERA using the popular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing~(OFDM) modulation as an example. We show that the ERA allows to severely degrade the available data rates even in entire networks. We present insights to the attack through analytical analysis, simulations, as well as experiments. Our results highlight that the attack also works with reasonably small IRS sizes. Finally, we implement an attacker setup and demonstrate a practical ERA to slow down a Wi-Fi network. </description>

      <title>Demiguise Attack: Crafting Invisible Semantic Adversarial Perturbations with Perceptual Similarity. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01396</link>
      <description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are malicious images with visually imperceptible perturbations. While these carefully crafted perturbations restricted with tight $\Lp$ norm bounds are small, they are still easily perceivable by humans. These perturbations also have limited success rates when attacking black-box models or models with defenses like noise reduction filters. To solve these problems, we propose Demiguise Attack, crafting ``unrestricted'' perturbations with Perceptual Similarity. Specifically, we can create powerful and photorealistic adversarial examples by manipulating semantic information based on Perceptual Similarity. Adversarial examples we generate are friendly to the human visual system (HVS), although the perturbations are of large magnitudes. We extend widely-used attacks with our approach, enhancing adversarial effectiveness impressively while contributing to imperceptibility. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method not only outperforms various state-of-the-art attacks in terms of fooling rate, transferability, and robustness against defenses but can also improve attacks effectively. In addition, we also notice that our implementation can simulate illumination and contrast changes that occur in real-world scenarios, which will contribute to exposing the blind spots of DNNs. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00561</link>
      <description>  We present DeClaW, a system for detecting, classifying, and warning of adversarial inputs presented to a classification neural network. In contrast to current state-of-the-art methods that, given an input, detect whether an input is clean or adversarial, we aim to also identify the types of adversarial attack (e.g., PGD, Carlini-Wagner or clean). To achieve this, we extract statistical profiles, which we term as anomaly feature vectors, from a set of latent features. Preliminary findings suggest that AFVs can help distinguish among several types of adversarial attacks (e.g., PGD versus Carlini-Wagner) with close to 93% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The results open the door to using AFV-based methods for exploring not only adversarial attack detection but also classification of the attack type and then design of attack-specific mitigation strategies. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00415</link>
      <description>  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), despite being energy-efficient when implemented on neuromorphic hardware and coupled with event-based Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), are vulnerable to security threats, such as adversarial attacks, i.e., small perturbations added to the input for inducing a misclassification. Toward this, we propose DVS-Attacks, a set of stealthy yet efficient adversarial attack methodologies targeted to perturb the event sequences that compose the input of the SNNs. First, we show that noise filters for DVS can be used as defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks. Afterwards, we implement several attacks and test them in the presence of two types of noise filters for DVS cameras. The experimental results show that the filters can only partially defend the SNNs against our proposed DVS-Attacks. Using the best settings for the noise filters, our proposed Mask Filter-Aware Dash Attack reduces the accuracy by more than 20% on the DVS-Gesture dataset and by more than 65% on the MNIST dataset, compared to the original clean frames. The source code of all the proposed DVS-Attacks and noise filters is released at https://github.com/albertomarchisio/DVS-Attacks. </description>

      <title>CLINE: Contrastive Learning with Semantic Negative Examples for Natural Language Understanding. (68%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00440</link>
      <description>  Despite pre-trained language models have proven useful for learning high-quality semantic representations, these models are still vulnerable to simple perturbations. Recent works aimed to improve the robustness of pre-trained models mainly focus on adversarial training from perturbed examples with similar semantics, neglecting the utilization of different or even opposite semantics. Different from the image processing field, the text is discrete and few word substitutions can cause significant semantic changes. To study the impact of semantics caused by small perturbations, we conduct a series of pilot experiments and surprisingly find that adversarial training is useless or even harmful for the model to detect these semantic changes. To address this problem, we propose Contrastive Learning with semantIc Negative Examples (CLINE), which constructs semantic negative examples unsupervised to improve the robustness under semantically adversarial attacking. By comparing with similar and opposite semantic examples, the model can effectively perceive the semantic changes caused by small perturbations. Empirical results show that our approach yields substantial improvements on a range of sentiment analysis, reasoning, and reading comprehension tasks. And CLINE also ensures the compactness within the same semantics and separability across different semantics in sentence-level. </description>

      <title>Spotting adversarial samples for speaker verification by neural vocoders. (26%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00309</link>
      <description>  Automatic speaker verification (ASV), one of the most important technology for biometric identification, has been widely adopted in security-critic applications, including transaction authentication and access control. However, previous works have shown ASV is seriously vulnerable to recently emerged adversarial attacks, yet effective countermeasures against them are limited. In this paper, we adopt neural vocoders to spot adversarial samples for ASV. We use neural vocoder to re-synthesize audio and find that the difference between the ASV scores for the original and re-synthesized audio is a good indicator to distinguish genuine and adversarial samples. As the very beginning work in this direction of detecting adversarial samples for ASV, there is no reliable baseline for comparison. So we first implement Griffin-Lim for detection and set it as our baseline. The proposed method accomplishes effective detection performance and outperforms all the baselines in all the settings. We also show the neural vocoder adopted in the detection framework is dataset independent. Our codes will be made open-source for future works to do comparison. </description>

      <title>The Interplay between Distribution Parameters and the Accuracy-Robustness Tradeoff in Classification. (16%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00247</link>
      <description>  Adversarial training tends to result in models that are less accurate on natural (unperturbed) examples compared to standard models. This can be attributed to either an algorithmic shortcoming or a fundamental property of the training data distribution, which admits different solutions for optimal standard and adversarial classifiers. In this work, we focus on the latter case under a binary Gaussian mixture classification problem. Unlike earlier work, we aim to derive the natural accuracy gap between the optimal Bayes and adversarial classifiers, and study the effect of different distributional parameters, namely separation between class centroids, class proportions, and the covariance matrix, on the derived gap. We show that under certain conditions, the natural error of the optimal adversarial classifier, as well as the gap, are locally minimized when classes are balanced, contradicting the performance of the Bayes classifier where perfect balance induces the worst accuracy. Moreover, we show that with an $\ell_\infty$ bounded perturbation and an adversarial budget of $\epsilon$, this gap is $\Theta(\epsilon^2)$ for the worst-case parameters, which for suitably small $\epsilon$ indicates the theoretical possibility of achieving robust classifiers with near-perfect accuracy, which is rarely reflected in practical algorithms. </description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Feedback-Enabled Cyber Resilience. (10%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00783</link>
      <description>  The rapid growth in the number of devices and their connectivity has enlarged the attack surface and weakened cyber systems. As attackers become increasingly sophisticated and resourceful, mere reliance on traditional cyber protection, such as intrusion detection, firewalls, and encryption, is insufficient to secure cyber systems. Cyber resilience provides a new security paradigm that complements inadequate protection with resilience mechanisms. A Cyber-Resilient Mechanism (CRM) adapts to the known or zero-day threats and uncertainties in real-time and strategically responds to them to maintain the critical functions of the cyber systems. Feedback architectures play a pivotal role in enabling the online sensing, reasoning, and actuation of the CRM. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an important class of algorithms that epitomize the feedback architectures for cyber resiliency, allowing the CRM to provide dynamic and sequential responses to attacks with limited prior knowledge of the attacker. In this work, we review the literature on RL for cyber resiliency and discuss the cyber-resilient defenses against three major types of vulnerabilities, i.e., posture-related, information-related, and human-related vulnerabilities. We introduce moving target defense, defensive cyber deception, and assistive human security technologies as three application domains of CRMs to elaborate on their designs. The RL technique also has vulnerabilities itself. We explain the major vulnerabilities of RL and present several attack models in which the attacks target the rewards, the measurements, and the actuators. We show that the attacker can trick the RL agent into learning a nefarious policy with minimum attacking effort, which shows serious security concerns for RL-enabled systems. Finally, we discuss the future challenges of RL for cyber security and resiliency and emerging applications of RL-based CRMs. </description>

      <title>Single-Step Adversarial Training for Semantic Segmentation. (96%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15998</link>
      <description>  Even though deep neural networks succeed on many different tasks including semantic segmentation, they lack on robustness against adversarial examples. To counteract this exploit, often adversarial training is used. However, it is known that adversarial training with weak adversarial attacks (e.g. using the Fast Gradient Method) does not improve the robustness against stronger attacks. Recent research shows that it is possible to increase the robustness of such single-step methods by choosing an appropriate step size during the training. Finding such a step size, without increasing the computational effort of single-step adversarial training, is still an open challenge. In this work we address the computationally particularly demanding task of semantic segmentation and propose a new step size control algorithm that increases the robustness of single-step adversarial training. The proposed algorithm does not increase the computational effort of single-step adversarial training considerably and also simplifies training, because it is free of meta-parameter. We show that the robustness of our approach can compete with multi-step adversarial training on two popular benchmarks for semantic segmentation. </description>

      <title>Explanation-Guided Diagnosis of Machine Learning Evasion Attacks. (82%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15820</link>
      <description>  Machine Learning (ML) models are susceptible to evasion attacks. Evasion accuracy is typically assessed using aggregate evasion rate, and it is an open question whether aggregate evasion rate enables feature-level diagnosis on the effect of adversarial perturbations on evasive predictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that harnesses explainable ML methods to guide high-fidelity assessment of ML evasion attacks. Our framework enables explanation-guided correlation analysis between pre-evasion perturbations and post-evasion explanations. Towards systematic assessment of ML evasion attacks, we propose and evaluate a novel suite of model-agnostic metrics for sample-level and dataset-level correlation analysis. Using malware and image classifiers, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse model architectures and complementary feature representations. Our explanation-guided correlation analysis reveals correlation gaps between adversarial samples and the corresponding perturbations performed on them. Using a case study on explanation-guided evasion, we show the broader usage of our methodology for assessing robustness of ML models. </description>

      <title>Understanding Adversarial Attacks on Observations in Deep Reinforcement Learning. (80%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15860</link>
      <description>  Recent works demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which can decrease the victim's total reward by manipulating the observations. Compared with adversarial attacks in supervised learning, it is much more challenging to deceive a DRL model since the adversary has to infer the environmental dynamics. To address this issue, we reformulate the problem of adversarial attacks in function space and separate the previous gradient based attacks into several subspace. Following the analysis of the function space, we design a generic two-stage framework in the subspace where the adversary lures the agent to a target trajectory or a deceptive policy. In the first stage, we train a deceptive policy by hacking the environment, and discover a set of trajectories routing to the lowest reward. The adversary then misleads the victim to imitate the deceptive policy by perturbing the observations. Our method provides a tighter theoretical upper bound for the attacked agent's performance than the existing approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method and we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on both Atari and MuJoCo environments. </description>

      <title>Bi-Level Poisoning Attack Model and Countermeasure for Appliance Consumption Data of Smart Homes. (8%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02897</link>
      <description>  Accurate building energy prediction is useful in various applications starting from building energy automation and management to optimal storage control. However, vulnerabilities should be considered when designing building energy prediction models, as intelligent attackers can deliberately influence the model performance using sophisticated attack models. These may consequently degrade the prediction accuracy, which may affect the efficiency and performance of the building energy management systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact of bi-level poisoning attacks on regression models of energy usage obtained from household appliances. Furthermore, an effective countermeasure against the poisoning attacks on the prediction model is proposed in this paper. Attacks and defenses are evaluated on a benchmark dataset. Experimental results show that an intelligent cyber-attacker can poison the prediction model to manipulate the decision. However, our proposed solution successfully ensures defense against such poisoning attacks effectively compared to other benchmark techniques. </description>

      <title>Exploring Robustness of Neural Networks through Graph Measures. (8%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15850</link>
      <description>  Motivated by graph theory, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are traditionally structured as layers of neurons (nodes), which learn useful information by the passage of data through interconnections (edges). In the machine learning realm, graph structures (i.e., neurons and connections) of ANNs have recently been explored using various graph-theoretic measures linked to their predictive performance. On the other hand, in network science (NetSci), certain graph measures including entropy and curvature are known to provide insight into the robustness and fragility of real-world networks. In this work, we use these graph measures to explore the robustness of various ANNs to adversarial attacks. To this end, we (1) explore the design space of inter-layer and intra-layers connectivity regimes of ANNs in the graph domain and record their predictive performance after training under different types of adversarial attacks, (2) use graph representations for both inter-layer and intra-layers connectivity regimes to calculate various graph-theoretic measures, including curvature and entropy, and (3) analyze the relationship between these graph measures and the adversarial performance of ANNs. We show that curvature and entropy, while operating in the graph domain, can quantify the robustness of ANNs without having to train these ANNs. Our results suggest that the real-world networks, including brain networks, financial networks, and social networks may provide important clues to the neural architecture search for robust ANNs. We propose a search strategy that efficiently finds robust ANNs amongst a set of well-performing ANNs without having a need to train all of these ANNs. </description>

      <title>A Context-Aware Information-Based Clone Node Attack Detection Scheme in Internet of Things. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15890</link>
      <description>  The rapidly expanding nature of the Internet of Things (IoT) networks is beginning to attract interest across a range of applications, including smart homes, smart transportation, smart health, and industrial contexts. This cutting-edge technology enables individuals to track and control their integrated environment in real-time and remotely via a thousand IoT devices comprised of sensors and actuators that actively participate in sensing, processing, storing, and sharing information. Nonetheless, IoT devices are frequently deployed in hostile environments, wherein adversaries attempt to capture and breach them in order to seize control of the entire network. One such example of potentially malicious behaviour is the cloning of IoT devices, in which an attacker can physically capture the devices, obtain some sensitive information, duplicate the devices, and intelligently deploy them in desired locations to conduct various insider attacks. A device cloning attack on IoT networks is a significant security concern since it allows for selective forwarding, sink-hole, and black-hole attacks. To address this issue, this paper provides an efficient scheme for detecting clone node attacks on IoT networks that makes use of semantic information about IoT devices known as context information sensed from the deployed environment to locate them securely. We design a location proof mechanism by combining location proofs and batch verification of the extended elliptic curve digital signature technique to accelerate the verification process at selected trusted nodes. We demonstrate the security of our scheme and its resilience to secure clone node attack detection by conducting a comprehensive security analysis. The performance of our proposed scheme provides a high degree of detection accuracy with minimal detection time and significantly reduces the computation, communication and storage overhead. </description>

      <title>Understanding and Improving Early Stopping for Learning with Noisy Labels. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15853</link>
      <description>  The memorization effect of deep neural network (DNN) plays a pivotal role in many state-of-the-art label-noise learning methods. To exploit this property, the early stopping trick, which stops the optimization at the early stage of training, is usually adopted. Current methods generally decide the early stopping point by considering a DNN as a whole. However, a DNN can be considered as a composition of a series of layers, and we find that the latter layers in a DNN are much more sensitive to label noise, while their former counterparts are quite robust. Therefore, selecting a stopping point for the whole network may make different DNN layers antagonistically affected each other, thus degrading the final performance. In this paper, we propose to separate a DNN into different parts and progressively train them to address this problem. Instead of the early stopping, which trains a whole DNN all at once, we initially train former DNN layers by optimizing the DNN with a relatively large number of epochs. During training, we progressively train the latter DNN layers by using a smaller number of epochs with the preceding layers fixed to counteract the impact of noisy labels. We term the proposed method as progressive early stopping (PES). Despite its simplicity, compared with the early stopping, PES can help to obtain more promising and stable results. Furthermore, by combining PES with existing approaches on noisy label training, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks. </description>

      <title>Adversarial Machine Learning for Cybersecurity and Computer Vision: Current Developments and Challenges. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02894</link>
      <description>  We provide a comprehensive overview of adversarial machine learning focusing on two application domains, i.e., cybersecurity and computer vision. Research in adversarial machine learning addresses a significant threat to the wide application of machine learning techniques -- they are vulnerable to carefully crafted attacks from malicious adversaries. For example, deep neural networks fail to correctly classify adversarial images, which are generated by adding imperceptible perturbations to clean images.We first discuss three main categories of attacks against machine learning techniques -- poisoning attacks, evasion attacks, and privacy attacks. Then the corresponding defense approaches are introduced along with the weakness and limitations of the existing defense approaches. We notice adversarial samples in cybersecurity and computer vision are fundamentally different. While adversarial samples in cybersecurity often have different properties/distributions compared with training data, adversarial images in computer vision are created with minor input perturbations. This further complicates the development of robust learning techniques, because a robust learning technique must withstand different types of attacks. </description>

      <title>Understanding Adversarial Examples Through Deep Neural Network's Response Surface and Uncertainty Regions. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00003</link>
      <description>  Deep neural network (DNN) is a popular model implemented in many systems to handle complex tasks such as image classification, object recognition, natural language processing etc. Consequently DNN structural vulnerabilities become part of the security vulnerabilities in those systems. In this paper we study the root cause of DNN adversarial examples. We examine the DNN response surface to understand its classification boundary. Our study reveals the structural problem of DNN classification boundary that leads to the adversarial examples. Existing attack algorithms can generate from a handful to a few hundred adversarial examples given one clean image. We show there are infinitely many adversarial images given one clean sample, all within a small neighborhood of the clean sample. We then define DNN uncertainty regions and show transferability of adversarial examples is not universal. We also argue that generalization error, the large sample theoretical guarantee established for DNN, cannot adequately capture the phenomenon of adversarial examples. We need new theory to measure DNN robustness. </description>

      <title>Attack Transferability Characterization for Adversarially Robust Multi-label Classification. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15360</link>
      <description>  Despite of the pervasive existence of multi-label evasion attack, it is an open yet essential problem to characterize the origin of the adversarial vulnerability of a multi-label learning system and assess its attackability. In this study, we focus on non-targeted evasion attack against multi-label classifiers. The goal of the threat is to cause miss-classification with respect to as many labels as possible, with the same input perturbation. Our work gains in-depth understanding about the multi-label adversarial attack by first characterizing the transferability of the attack based on the functional properties of the multi-label classifier. We unveil how the transferability level of the attack determines the attackability of the classifier via establishing an information-theoretic analysis of the adversarial risk. Furthermore, we propose a transferability-centered attackability assessment, named Soft Attackability Estimator (SAE), to evaluate the intrinsic vulnerability level of the targeted multi-label classifier. This estimator is then integrated as a transferability-tuning regularization term into the multi-label learning paradigm to achieve adversarially robust classification. The experimental study on real-world data echos the theoretical analysis and verify the validity of the transferability-regularized multi-label learning method. </description>

      <title>Inconspicuous Adversarial Patches for Fooling Image Recognition Systems on Mobile Devices. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15202</link>
      <description>  Deep learning based image recognition systems have been widely deployed on mobile devices in today's world. In recent studies, however, deep learning models are shown vulnerable to adversarial examples. One variant of adversarial examples, called adversarial patch, draws researchers' attention due to its strong attack abilities. Though adversarial patches achieve high attack success rates, they are easily being detected because of the visual inconsistency between the patches and the original images. Besides, it usually requires a large amount of data for adversarial patch generation in the literature, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, we propose an approach to generate inconspicuous adversarial patches with one single image. In our approach, we first decide the patch locations basing on the perceptual sensitivity of victim models, then produce adversarial patches in a coarse-to-fine way by utilizing multiple-scale generators and discriminators. The patches are encouraged to be consistent with the background images with adversarial training while preserving strong attack abilities. Our approach shows the strong attack abilities in white-box settings and the excellent transferability in black-box settings through extensive experiments on various models with different architectures and training methods. Compared to other adversarial patches, our adversarial patches hold the most negligible risks to be detected and can evade human observations, which is supported by the illustrations of saliency maps and results of user evaluations. Lastly, we show that our adversarial patches can be applied in the physical world. </description>

      <title>Bio-Inspired Adversarial Attack Against Deep Neural Networks. (98%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02895</link>
      <description>  The paper develops a new adversarial attack against deep neural networks (DNN), based on applying bio-inspired design to moving physical objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce physical attacks with a moving object. Instead of following the dominating attack strategy in the existing literature, i.e., to introduce minor perturbations to a digital input or a stationary physical object, we show two new successful attack strategies in this paper. We show by superimposing several patterns onto one physical object, a DNN becomes confused and picks one of the patterns to assign a class label. Our experiment with three flapping wing robots demonstrates the possibility of developing an adversarial camouflage to cause a targeted mistake by DNN. We also show certain motion can reduce the dependency among consecutive frames in a video and make an object detector &quot;blind&quot;, i.e., not able to detect an object exists in the video. Hence in a successful physical attack against DNN, targeted motion against the system should also be considered. </description>

      <title>Do Not Deceive Your Employer with a Virtual Background: A Video Conferencing Manipulation-Detection System. (62%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15130</link>
      <description>  The last-generation video conferencing software allows users to utilize a virtual background to conceal their personal environment due to privacy concerns, especially in official meetings with other employers. On the other hand, users maybe want to fool people in the meeting by considering the virtual background to conceal where they are. In this case, developing tools to understand the virtual background utilize for fooling people in meeting plays an important role. Besides, such detectors must prove robust against different kinds of attacks since a malicious user can fool the detector by applying a set of adversarial editing steps on the video to conceal any revealing footprint. In this paper, we study the feasibility of an efficient tool to detect whether a videoconferencing user background is real. In particular, we provide the first tool which computes pixel co-occurrences matrices and uses them to search for inconsistencies among spectral and spatial bands. Our experiments confirm that cross co-occurrences matrices improve the robustness of the detector against different kinds of attacks. This work's performance is especially noteworthy with regard to color SPAM features. Moreover, the performance especially is significant with regard to robustness versus post-processing, like geometric transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, and JPEG compression with different quality factors. </description>

      <title>The Threat of Offensive AI to Organizations. (54%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15764</link>
      <description>  AI has provided us with the ability to automate tasks, extract information from vast amounts of data, and synthesize media that is nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. However, positive tools can also be used for negative purposes. In particular, cyber adversaries can use AI (such as machine learning) to enhance their attacks and expand their campaigns.   Although offensive AI has been discussed in the past, there is a need to analyze and understand the threat in the context of organizations. For example, how does an AI-capable adversary impact the cyber kill chain? Does AI benefit the attacker more than the defender? What are the most significant AI threats facing organizations today and what will be their impact on the future?   In this survey, we explore the threat of offensive AI on organizations. First, we present the background and discuss how AI changes the adversary's methods, strategies, goals, and overall attack model. Then, through a literature review, we identify 33 offensive AI capabilities which adversaries can use to enhance their attacks. Finally, through a user study spanning industry and academia, we rank the AI threats and provide insights on the adversaries. </description>

      <title>Local Reweighting for Adversarial Training. (22%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15776</link>
      <description>  Instances-reweighted adversarial training (IRAT) can significantly boost the robustness of trained models, where data being less/more vulnerable to the given attack are assigned smaller/larger weights during training. However, when tested on attacks different from the given attack simulated in training, the robustness may drop significantly (e.g., even worse than no reweighting). In this paper, we study this problem and propose our solution--locally reweighted adversarial training (LRAT). The rationale behind IRAT is that we do not need to pay much attention to an instance that is already safe under the attack. We argue that the safeness should be attack-dependent, so that for the same instance, its weight can change given different attacks based on the same model. Thus, if the attack simulated in training is mis-specified, the weights of IRAT are misleading. To this end, LRAT pairs each instance with its adversarial variants and performs local reweighting inside each pair, while performing no global reweighting--the rationale is to fit the instance itself if it is immune to the attack, but not to skip the pair, in order to passively defend different attacks in future. Experiments show that LRAT works better than both IRAT (i.e., global reweighting) and the standard AT (i.e., no reweighting) when trained with an attack and tested on different attacks. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15355</link>
      <description>  A myriad of explainability methods have been proposed in recent years, but there is little consensus on how to evaluate them. While automatic metrics allow for quick benchmarking, it isn't clear how such metrics reflect human interaction with explanations. Human evaluation is of paramount importance, but previous protocols fail to account for belief biases affecting human performance, which may lead to misleading conclusions. We provide an overview of belief bias, its role in human evaluation, and ideas for NLP practitioners on how to account for it. For two experimental paradigms, we present a case study of gradient-based explainability introducing simple ways to account for humans' prior beliefs: models of varying quality and adversarial examples. We show that conclusions about the highest performing methods change when introducing such controls, pointing to the importance of accounting for belief bias in evaluation. </description>

      <title>Feature Importance Guided Attack: A Model Agnostic Adversarial Attack. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14815</link>
      <description>  Machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks which dramatically reduce their performance. Reliable defenses to these attacks are an unsolved challenge. In this work, we present a novel evasion attack: the 'Feature Importance Guided Attack' (FIGA) which generates adversarial evasion samples. FIGA is model agnostic, it assumes no prior knowledge of the defending model's learning algorithm, but does assume knowledge of the feature representation. FIGA leverages feature importance rankings; it perturbs the most important features of the input in the direction of the target class we wish to mimic. We demonstrate FIGA against eight phishing detection models. We keep the attack realistic by perturbing phishing website features that an adversary would have control over. Using FIGA we are able to cause a reduction in the F1-score of a phishing detection model from 0.96 to 0.41 on average. Finally, we implement adversarial training as a defense against FIGA and show that while it is sometimes effective, it can be evaded by changing the parameters of FIGA. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15023</link>
      <description>  Evading adversarial example detection defenses requires finding adversarial examples that must simultaneously (a) be misclassified by the model and (b) be detected as non-adversarial. We find that existing attacks that attempt to satisfy multiple simultaneous constraints often over-optimize against one constraint at the cost of satisfying another. We introduce Orthogonal Projected Gradient Descent, an improved attack technique to generate adversarial examples that avoids this problem by orthogonalizing the gradients when running standard gradient-based attacks. We use our technique to evade four state-of-the-art detection defenses, reducing their accuracy to 0% while maintaining a 0% detection rate. </description>

      <title>Improving Transferability of Adversarial Patches on Face Recognition with Generative Models. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15058</link>
      <description>  Face recognition is greatly improved by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, these face recognition models have been used for identity authentication in security sensitive applications. However, deep CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patches, which are physically realizable and stealthy, raising new security concerns on the real-world applications of these models. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of face recognition models using adversarial patches based on transferability, where the attacker has limited accessibility to the target models. First, we extend the existing transfer-based attack techniques to generate transferable adversarial patches. However, we observe that the transferability is sensitive to initialization and degrades when the perturbation magnitude is large, indicating the overfitting to the substitute models. Second, we propose to regularize the adversarial patches on the low dimensional data manifold. The manifold is represented by generative models pre-trained on legitimate human face images. Using face-like features as adversarial perturbations through optimization on the manifold, we show that the gaps between the responses of substitute models and the target models dramatically decrease, exhibiting a better transferability. Extensive digital world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in the black-box setting. We apply the proposed method in the physical world as well. </description>

      <title>Data Poisoning Won't Save You From Facial Recognition. (93%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14851</link>
      <description>  Data poisoning has been proposed as a compelling defense against facial recognition models trained on Web-scraped pictures. By perturbing the images they post online, users can fool models into misclassifying future (unperturbed) pictures. We demonstrate that this strategy provides a false sense of security, as it ignores an inherent asymmetry between the parties: users' pictures are perturbed once and for all before being published (at which point they are scraped) and must thereafter fool all future models -- including models trained adaptively against the users' past attacks, or models that use technologies discovered after the attack. We evaluate two systems for poisoning attacks against large-scale facial recognition, Fawkes (500,000+ downloads) and LowKey. We demonstrate how an &quot;oblivious&quot; model trainer can simply wait for future developments in computer vision to nullify the protection of pictures collected in the past. We further show that an adversary with black-box access to the attack can (i) train a robust model that resists the perturbations of collected pictures and (ii) detect poisoned pictures uploaded online. We caution that facial recognition poisoning will not admit an &quot;arms race&quot; between attackers and defenders. Once perturbed pictures are scraped, the attack cannot be changed so any future successful defense irrevocably undermines users' privacy. </description>

      <description>  In this paper, we introduce adversarially robust streaming algorithms for central machine learning and algorithmic tasks, such as regression and clustering, as well as their more general counterparts, subspace embedding, low-rank approximation, and coreset construction. For regression and other numerical linear algebra related tasks, we consider the row arrival streaming model. Our results are based on a simple, but powerful, observation that many importance sampling-based algorithms give rise to adversarial robustness which is in contrast to sketching based algorithms, which are very prevalent in the streaming literature but suffer from adversarial attacks. In addition, we show that the well-known merge and reduce paradigm in streaming is adversarially robust. Since the merge and reduce paradigm allows coreset constructions in the streaming setting, we thus obtain robust algorithms for $k$-means, $k$-median, $k$-center, Bregman clustering, projective clustering, principal component analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorization. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first adversarially robust results for these problems yet require no new algorithmic implementations. Finally, we empirically confirm the robustness of our algorithms on various adversarial attacks and demonstrate that by contrast, some common existing algorithms are not robust.

      <title>Test-Time Adaptation to Distribution Shift by Confidence Maximization and Input Transformation. (2%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14999</link>
      <description>  Deep neural networks often exhibit poor performance on data that is unlikely under the train-time data distribution, for instance data affected by corruptions. Previous works demonstrate that test-time adaptation to data shift, for instance using entropy minimization, effectively improves performance on such shifted distributions. This paper focuses on the fully test-time adaptation setting, where only unlabeled data from the target distribution is required. This allows adapting arbitrary pretrained networks. Specifically, we propose a novel loss that improves test-time adaptation by addressing both premature convergence and instability of entropy minimization. This is achieved by replacing the entropy by a non-saturating surrogate and adding a diversity regularizer based on batch-wise entropy maximization that prevents convergence to trivial collapsed solutions. Moreover, we propose to prepend an input transformation module to the network that can partially undo test-time distribution shifts. Surprisingly, this preprocessing can be learned solely using the fully test-time adaptation loss in an end-to-end fashion without any target domain labels or source domain data. We show that our approach outperforms previous work in improving the robustness of publicly available pretrained image classifiers to common corruptions on such challenging benchmarks as ImageNet-C. </description>

      <title>Realtime Robust Malicious Traffic Detection via Frequency Domain Analysis. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14707</link>
      <description>  Machine learning (ML) based malicious traffic detection is an emerging security paradigm, particularly for zero-day attack detection, which is complementary to existing rule based detection. However, the existing ML based detection has low detection accuracy and low throughput incurred by inefficient traffic features extraction. Thus, they cannot detect attacks in realtime especially in high throughput networks. Particularly, these detection systems similar to the existing rule based detection can be easily evaded by sophisticated attacks. To this end, we propose Whisper, a realtime ML based malicious traffic detection system that achieves both high accuracy and high throughput by utilizing frequency domain features. It utilizes sequential features represented by the frequency domain features to achieve bounded information loss, which ensures high detection accuracy, and meanwhile constrains the scale of features to achieve high detection throughput. Particularly, attackers cannot easily interfere with the frequency domain features and thus Whisper is robust against various evasion attacks. Our experiments with 42 types of attacks demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-theart systems, Whisper can accurately detect various sophisticated and stealthy attacks, achieving at most 18.36% improvement, while achieving two orders of magnitude throughput. Even under various evasion attacks, Whisper is still able to maintain around 90% detection accuracy. </description>

      <title>RAILS: A Robust Adversarial Immune-inspired Learning System. (96%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02840</link>
      <description>  Adversarial attacks against deep neural networks (DNNs) are continuously evolving, requiring increasingly powerful defense strategies. We develop a novel adversarial defense framework inspired by the adaptive immune system: the Robust Adversarial Immune-inspired Learning System (RAILS). Initializing a population of exemplars that is balanced across classes, RAILS starts from a uniform label distribution that encourages diversity and debiases a potentially corrupted initial condition. RAILS implements an evolutionary optimization process to adjust the label distribution and achieve specificity towards ground truth. RAILS displays a tradeoff between robustness (diversity) and accuracy (specificity), providing a new immune-inspired perspective on adversarial learning. We empirically validate the benefits of RAILS through several adversarial image classification experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 datasets. For the PGD attack, RAILS is found to improve the robustness over existing methods by &gt;= 5.62%, 12.5% and 10.32%, respectively, without appreciable loss of standard accuracy. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14152</link>
      <description>  We have seen a surge in research aims toward adversarial attacks and defenses in AI/ML systems. While it is crucial to formulate new attack methods and devise novel defense strategies for robustness, it is also imperative to recognize who is responsible for implementing, validating, and justifying the necessity of these defenses. In particular, which components of the system are vulnerable to what type of adversarial attacks, and the expertise needed to realize the severity of adversarial attacks. Also how to evaluate and address the adversarial challenges in order to recommend defense strategies for different applications. This paper opened a discussion on who should examine and implement the adversarial defenses and the reason behind such efforts. </description>

      <title>Immuno-mimetic Deep Neural Networks (Immuno-Net). (64%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02842</link>
      <description>  Biomimetics has played a key role in the evolution of artificial neural networks. Thus far, in silico metaphors have been dominated by concepts from neuroscience and cognitive psychology. In this paper we introduce a different type of biomimetic model, one that borrows concepts from the immune system, for designing robust deep neural networks. This immuno-mimetic model leads to a new computational biology framework for robustification of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. Within this Immuno-Net framework we define a robust adaptive immune-inspired learning system (Immuno-Net RAILS) that emulates, in silico, the adaptive biological mechanisms of B-cells that are used to defend a mammalian host against pathogenic attacks. When applied to image classification tasks on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that Immuno-net RAILS results in improvement of as much as 12.5% in adversarial accuracy of a baseline method, the DkNN-robustified CNN, without appreciable loss of accuracy on clean data. </description>

      <title>ASK: Adversarial Soft k-Nearest Neighbor Attack and Defense. (31%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14300</link>
      <description>  K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)-based deep learning methods have been applied to many applications due to their simplicity and geometric interpretability. However, the robustness of kNN-based classification models has not been thoroughly explored and kNN attack strategies are underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Soft kNN (ASK) loss to both design more effective kNN attack strategies and to develop better defenses against them. Our ASK loss approach has two advantages. First, ASK loss can better approximate the kNN's probability of classification error than objectives proposed in previous works. Second, the ASK loss is interpretable: it preserves the mutual information between the perturbed input and the kNN of the unperturbed input. We use the ASK loss to generate a novel attack method called the ASK-Attack (ASK-Atk), which shows superior attack efficiency and accuracy degradation relative to previous kNN attacks. Based on the ASK-Atk, we then derive an ASK-Defense (ASK-Def) method that optimizes the worst-case training loss induced by ASK-Atk. </description>

      <title>Stabilizing Equilibrium Models by Jacobian Regularization. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14342</link>
      <description>  Deep equilibrium networks (DEQs) are a new class of models that eschews traditional depth in favor of finding the fixed point of a single nonlinear layer. These models have been shown to achieve performance competitive with the state-of-the-art deep networks while using significantly less memory. Yet they are also slower, brittle to architectural choices, and introduce potential instability to the model. In this paper, we propose a regularization scheme for DEQ models that explicitly regularizes the Jacobian of the fixed-point update equations to stabilize the learning of equilibrium models. We show that this regularization adds only minimal computational cost, significantly stabilizes the fixed-point convergence in both forward and backward passes, and scales well to high-dimensional, realistic domains (e.g., WikiText-103 language modeling and ImageNet classification). Using this method, we demonstrate, for the first time, an implicit-depth model that runs with approximately the same speed and level of performance as popular conventional deep networks such as ResNet-101, while still maintaining the constant memory footprint and architectural simplicity of DEQs. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/deq . </description>

      <title>Multi-stage Optimization based Adversarial Training. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15357</link>
      <description>  In the field of adversarial robustness, there is a common practice that adopts the single-step adversarial training for quickly developing adversarially robust models. However, the single-step adversarial training is most likely to cause catastrophic overfitting, as after a few training epochs it will be hard to generate strong adversarial examples to continuously boost the adversarial robustness. In this work, we aim to avoid the catastrophic overfitting by introducing multi-step adversarial examples during the single-step adversarial training. Then, to balance the large training overhead of generating multi-step adversarial examples, we propose a Multi-stage Optimization based Adversarial Training (MOAT) method that periodically trains the model on mixed benign examples, single-step adversarial examples, and multi-step adversarial examples stage by stage. In this way, the overall training overhead is reduced significantly, meanwhile, the model could avoid catastrophic overfitting. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that under similar amount of training overhead, the proposed MOAT exhibits better robustness than either single-step or multi-step adversarial training methods. </description>

      <title>The Feasibility and Inevitability of Stealth Attacks. (68%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13997</link>
      <description>  We develop and study new adversarial perturbations that enable an attacker to gain control over decisions in generic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems including deep learning neural networks. In contrast to adversarial data modification, the attack mechanism we consider here involves alterations to the AI system itself. Such a stealth attack could be conducted by a mischievous, corrupt or disgruntled member of a software development team. It could also be made by those wishing to exploit a &quot;democratization of AI&quot; agenda, where network architectures and trained parameter sets are shared publicly. Building on work by [Tyukin et al., International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2020], we develop a range of new implementable attack strategies with accompanying analysis, showing that with high probability a stealth attack can be made transparent, in the sense that system performance is unchanged on a fixed validation set which is unknown to the attacker, while evoking any desired output on a trigger input of interest. The attacker only needs to have estimates of the size of the validation set and the spread of the AI's relevant latent space. In the case of deep learning neural networks, we show that a one neuron attack is possible - a modification to the weights and bias associated with a single neuron - revealing a vulnerability arising from over-parameterization. We illustrate these concepts in a realistic setting. Guided by the theory and computational results, we also propose strategies to guard against stealth attacks. </description>

      <title>On the (Un-)Avoidability of Adversarial Examples. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13326</link>
      <description>  The phenomenon of adversarial examples in deep learning models has caused substantial concern over their reliability. While many deep neural networks have shown impressive performance in terms of predictive accuracy, it has been shown that in many instances an imperceptible perturbation can falsely flip the network's prediction. Most research has then focused on developing defenses against adversarial attacks or learning under a worst-case adversarial loss. In this work, we take a step back and aim to provide a framework for determining whether a model's label change under small perturbation is justified (and when it is not). We carefully argue that adversarial robustness should be defined as a locally adaptive measure complying with the underlying distribution. We then suggest a definition for an adaptive robust loss, derive an empirical version of it, and develop a resulting data-augmentation framework. We prove that our adaptive data-augmentation maintains consistency of 1-nearest neighbor classification under deterministic labels and provide illustrative empirical evaluations. </description>

      <title>Countering Adversarial Examples: Combining Input Transformation and Noisy Training. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13394</link>
      <description>  Recent studies have shown that neural network (NN) based image classifiers are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, which poses a threat to security-sensitive image recognition task. Prior work has shown that JPEG compression can combat the drop in classification accuracy on adversarial examples to some extent. But, as the compression ratio increases, traditional JPEG compression is insufficient to defend those attacks but can cause an abrupt accuracy decline to the benign images. In this paper, with the aim of fully filtering the adversarial perturbations, we firstly make modifications to traditional JPEG compression algorithm which becomes more favorable for NN. Specifically, based on an analysis of the frequency coefficient, we design a NN-favored quantization table for compression. Considering compression as a data augmentation strategy, we then combine our model-agnostic preprocess with noisy training. We fine-tune the pre-trained model by training with images encoded at different compression levels, thus generating multiple classifiers. Finally, since lower (higher) compression ratio can remove both perturbations and original features slightly (aggressively), we use these trained multiple models for model ensemble. The majority vote of the ensemble of models is adopted as final predictions. Experiments results show our method can improve defense efficiency while maintaining original accuracy. </description>

      <title>Adversarial Examples in Multi-Layer Random ReLU Networks. (81%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12611</link>
      <description>  We consider the phenomenon of adversarial examples in ReLU networks with independent gaussian parameters. For networks of constant depth and with a large range of widths (for instance, it suffices if the width of each layer is polynomial in that of any other layer), small perturbations of input vectors lead to large changes of outputs. This generalizes results of Daniely and Schacham (2020) for networks of rapidly decreasing width and of Bubeck et al (2021) for two-layer networks. The proof shows that adversarial examples arise in these networks because the functions that they compute are very close to linear. Bottleneck layers in the network play a key role: the minimal width up to some point in the network determines scales and sensitivities of mappings computed up to that point. The main result is for networks with constant depth, but we also show that some constraint on depth is necessary for a result of this kind, because there are suitably deep networks that, with constant probability, compute a function that is close to constant. </description>

      <title>Teacher Model Fingerprinting Attacks Against Transfer Learning. (2%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12478</link>
      <description>  Transfer learning has become a common solution to address training data scarcity in practice. It trains a specified student model by reusing or fine-tuning early layers of a well-trained teacher model that is usually publicly available. However, besides utility improvement, the transferred public knowledge also brings potential threats to model confidentiality, and even further raises other security and privacy issues.   In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation of the teacher model exposure threat in the transfer learning context, aiming to gain a deeper insight into the tension between public knowledge and model confidentiality. To this end, we propose a teacher model fingerprinting attack to infer the origin of a student model, i.e., the teacher model it transfers from. Specifically, we propose a novel optimization-based method to carefully generate queries to probe the student model to realize our attack. Unlike existing model reverse engineering approaches, our proposed fingerprinting method neither relies on fine-grained model outputs, e.g., posteriors, nor auxiliary information of the model architecture or training dataset. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The empirical results demonstrate that our attack can accurately identify the model origin with few probing queries. Moreover, we show that the proposed attack can serve as a stepping stone to facilitating other attacks against machine learning models, such as model stealing. </description>

      <title>Feature Attributions and Counterfactual Explanations Can Be Manipulated. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12563</link>
      <description>  As machine learning models are increasingly used in critical decision-making settings (e.g., healthcare, finance), there has been a growing emphasis on developing methods to explain model predictions. Such \textit{explanations} are used to understand and establish trust in models and are vital components in machine learning pipelines. Though explanations are a critical piece in these systems, there is little understanding about how they are vulnerable to manipulation by adversaries. In this paper, we discuss how two broad classes of explanations are vulnerable to manipulation. We demonstrate how adversaries can design biased models that manipulate model agnostic feature attribution methods (e.g., LIME \&amp; SHAP) and counterfactual explanations that hill-climb during the counterfactual search (e.g., Wachter's Algorithm \&amp; DiCE) into \textit{concealing} the model's biases. These vulnerabilities allow an adversary to deploy a biased model, yet explanations will not reveal this bias, thereby deceiving stakeholders into trusting the model. We evaluate the manipulations on real world data sets, including COMPAS and Communities \&amp; Crime, and find explanations can be manipulated in practice. </description>

      <title>DetectX -- Adversarial Input Detection using Current Signatures in Memristive XBar Arrays. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12021</link>
      <description>  Adversarial input detection has emerged as a prominent technique to harden Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) against adversarial attacks. Most prior works use neural network-based detectors or complex statistical analysis for adversarial detection. These approaches are computationally intensive and vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To this end, we propose DetectX - a hardware friendly adversarial detection mechanism using hardware signatures like Sum of column Currents (SoI) in memristive crossbars (XBar). We show that adversarial inputs have higher SoI compared to clean inputs. However, the difference is too small for reliable adversarial detection. Hence, we propose a dual-phase training methodology: Phase1 training is geared towards increasing the separation between clean and adversarial SoIs; Phase2 training improves the overall robustness against different strengths of adversarial attacks. For hardware-based adversarial detection, we implement the DetectX module using 32nm CMOS circuits and integrate it with a Neurosim-like analog crossbar architecture. We perform hardware evaluation of the Neurosim+DetectX system on the Neurosim platform using datasets-CIFAR10(VGG8), CIFAR100(VGG16) and TinyImagenet(ResNet18). Our experiments show that DetectX is 10x-25x more energy efficient and immune to dynamic adversarial attacks compared to previous state-of-the-art works. Moreover, we achieve high detection performance (ROC-AUC &gt; 0.95) for strong white-box and black-box attacks.

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11644</link>
      <description>  We propose a novel and effective input transformation based adversarial defense method against gray- and black-box attack, which is computationally efficient and does not require any adversarial training or retraining of a classification model. We first show that a very simple iterative Gaussian smoothing can effectively wash out adversarial noise and achieve substantially high robust accuracy. Based on the observation, we propose Self-Supervised Iterative Contextual Smoothing (SSICS), which aims to reconstruct the original discriminative features from the Gaussian-smoothed image in context-adaptive manner, while still smoothing out the adversarial noise. From the experiments on ImageNet, we show that our SSICS achieves both high standard accuracy and very competitive robust accuracy for the gray- and black-box attacks; e.g., transfer-based PGD-attack and score-based attack. A note-worthy point to stress is that our defense is free of computationally expensive adversarial training, yet, can approach its robust accuracy via input transformation. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12900</link>
      <description>  Meta-learning model can quickly adapt to new tasks using few-shot labeled data. However, despite achieving good generalization on few-shot classification tasks, it is still challenging to improve the adversarial robustness of the meta-learning model in few-shot learning. Although adversarial training (AT) methods such as Adversarial Query (AQ) can improve the adversarially robust performance of meta-learning models, AT is still computationally expensive training. On the other hand, meta-learning models trained with AT will drop significant accuracy on the original clean images. This paper proposed a meta-learning method on the adversarially robust neural network called Long-term Cross Adversarial Training (LCAT). LCAT will update meta-learning model parameters cross along the natural and adversarial sample distribution direction with long-term to improve both adversarial and clean few-shot classification accuracy. Due to cross-adversarial training, LCAT only needs half of the adversarial training epoch than AQ, resulting in a low adversarial training computation. Experiment results show that LCAT achieves superior performance both on the clean and adversarial few-shot classification accuracy than SOTA adversarial training methods for meta-learning models. </description>

      <description>  Automatic code synthesis from natural language descriptions is a challenging task. We witness massive progress in developing code generation systems for domain-specific languages (DSLs) employing sequence-to-sequence deep learning techniques in the recent past. In this paper, we specifically experiment with \textsc{AlgoLisp} DSL-based generative models and showcase the existence of significant dataset bias through different classes of adversarial examples. We also experiment with two variants of Transformer-based models that outperform all existing \textsc{AlgoLisp} DSL-based code generation baselines. Consistent with the current state-of-the-art systems, our proposed models, too, achieve poor performance under adversarial settings. Therefore, we propose several dataset augmentation techniques to reduce bias and showcase their efficacy using robust experimentation. </description>

      <title>NetFense: Adversarial Defenses against Privacy Attacks on Neural Networks for Graph Data. (67%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11865</link>
      <description>  Recent advances in protecting node privacy on graph data and attacking graph neural networks (GNNs) gain much attention. The eye does not bring these two essential tasks together yet. Imagine an adversary can utilize the powerful GNNs to infer users' private labels in a social network. How can we adversarially defend against such privacy attacks while maintaining the utility of perturbed graphs? In this work, we propose a novel research task, adversarial defenses against GNN-based privacy attacks, and present a graph perturbation-based approach, NetFense, to achieve the goal. NetFense can simultaneously keep graph data unnoticeability (i.e., having limited changes on the graph structure), maintain the prediction confidence of targeted label classification (i.e., preserving data utility), and reduce the prediction confidence of private label classification (i.e., protecting the privacy of nodes). Experiments conducted on single- and multiple-target perturbations using three real graph data exhibit that the perturbed graphs by NetFense can effectively maintain data utility (i.e., model unnoticeability) on targeted label classification and significantly decrease the prediction confidence of private label classification (i.e., privacy protection). Extensive studies also bring several insights, such as the flexibility of NetFense, preserving local neighborhoods in data unnoticeability, and better privacy protection for high-degree nodes. </description>

      <title>Policy Smoothing for Provably Robust Reinforcement Learning. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11420</link>
      <description>  The study of provable adversarial robustness for deep neural network (DNN) models has mainly focused on static supervised learning tasks such as image classification. However, DNNs have been used extensively in real-world adaptive tasks such as reinforcement learning (RL), making RL systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The key challenge in adversarial RL is that the attacker can adapt itself to the defense strategy used by the agent in previous time-steps to strengthen its attack in future steps. In this work, we study the provable robustness of RL against norm-bounded adversarial perturbations of the inputs. We focus on smoothing-based provable defenses and propose policy smoothing where the agent adds a Gaussian noise to its observation at each time-step before applying the policy network to make itself less sensitive to adversarial perturbations of its inputs. Our main theoretical contribution is to prove an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma where the adversarial perturbation at a particular time can be a stochastic function of current and previous observations and states as well as previously observed actions. Using this lemma, we adapt the robustness certificates produced by randomized smoothing in the static setting of image classification to the dynamic setting of RL. We generate certificates that guarantee that the total reward obtained by the smoothed policy will not fall below a certain threshold under a norm-bounded adversarial perturbation of the input. We show that our certificates are tight by constructing a worst-case setting that achieves the bounds derived in our analysis. In our experiments, we show that this method can yield meaningful certificates in complex environments demonstrating its effectiveness against adversarial attacks. </description>

      <title>Delving into the pixels of adversarial samples. (98%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10996</link>
      <description>  Despite extensive research into adversarial attacks, we do not know how adversarial attacks affect image pixels. Knowing how image pixels are affected by adversarial attacks has the potential to lead us to better adversarial defenses. Motivated by instances that we find where strong attacks do not transfer, we delve into adversarial examples at pixel level to scrutinize how adversarial attacks affect image pixel values. We consider several ImageNet architectures, InceptionV3, VGG19 and ResNet50, as well as several strong attacks. We find that attacks can have different effects at pixel level depending on classifier architecture. In particular, input pre-processing plays a previously overlooked role in the effect that attacks have on pixels. Based on the insights of pixel-level examination, we find new ways to detect some of the strongest current attacks. </description>

      <title>Hardness of Samples Is All You Need: Protecting Deep Learning Models Using Hardness of Samples. (98%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11424</link>
      <description>  Several recent studies have shown that Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based classifiers are vulnerable against model extraction attacks. In model extraction attacks, an adversary exploits the target classifier to create a surrogate classifier imitating the target classifier with respect to some criteria. In this paper, we investigate the hardness degree of samples and demonstrate that the hardness degree histogram of model extraction attacks samples is distinguishable from the hardness degree histogram of normal samples. Normal samples come from the target classifier's training data distribution. As the training process of DNN-based classifiers is done in several epochs, we can consider this process as a sequence of subclassifiers so that each subclassifier is created at the end of an epoch. We use the sequence of subclassifiers to calculate the hardness degree of samples. We investigate the relation between hardness degree of samples and the trust in the classifier outputs. We propose Hardness-Oriented Detection Approach (HODA) to detect the sample sequences of model extraction attacks. The results demonstrate that HODA can detect the sample sequences of model extraction attacks with a high success rate by only watching 100 attack samples. We also investigate the hardness degree of adversarial examples and indicate that the hardness degree histogram of adversarial examples is distinct from the hardness degree histogram of normal samples. </description>

      <title>Friendly Training: Neural Networks Can Adapt Data To Make Learning Easier. (91%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10974</link>
      <description>  In the last decade, motivated by the success of Deep Learning, the scientific community proposed several approaches to make the learning procedure of Neural Networks more effective. When focussing on the way in which the training data are provided to the learning machine, we can distinguish between the classic random selection of stochastic gradient-based optimization and more involved techniques that devise curricula to organize data, and progressively increase the complexity of the training set. In this paper, we propose a novel training procedure named Friendly Training that, differently from the aforementioned approaches, involves altering the training examples in order to help the model to better fulfil its learning criterion. The model is allowed to simplify those examples that are too hard to be classified at a certain stage of the training procedure. The data transformation is controlled by a developmental plan that progressively reduces its impact during training, until it completely vanishes. In a sense, this is the opposite of what is commonly done in order to increase robustness against adversarial examples, i.e., Adversarial Training. Experiments on multiple datasets are provided, showing that Friendly Training yields improvements with respect to informed data sub-selection routines and random selection, especially in deep convolutional architectures. Results suggest that adapting the input data is a feasible way to stabilize learning and improve the generalization skills of the network. </description>

      <title>Membership Inference on Word Embedding and Beyond. (38%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11384</link>
      <description>  In the text processing context, most ML models are built on word embeddings. These embeddings are themselves trained on some datasets, potentially containing sensitive data. In some cases this training is done independently, in other cases, it occurs as part of training a larger, task-specific model. In either case, it is of interest to consider membership inference attacks based on the embedding layer as a way of understanding sensitive information leakage. But, somewhat surprisingly, membership inference attacks on word embeddings and their effect in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks that use these embeddings, have remained relatively unexplored.   In this work, we show that word embeddings are vulnerable to black-box membership inference attacks under realistic assumptions. Furthermore, we show that this leakage persists through two other major NLP applications: classification and text-generation, even when the embedding layer is not exposed to the attacker. We show that our MI attack achieves high attack accuracy against a classifier model and an LSTM-based language model. Indeed, our attack is a cheaper membership inference attack on text-generative models, which does not require the knowledge of the target model or any expensive training of text-generative models as shadow models. </description>

      <title>An Alternative Auxiliary Task for Enhancing Image Classification. (11%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11478</link>
      <description>  Image reconstruction is likely the most predominant auxiliary task for image classification. In this paper, we investigate ``estimating the Fourier Transform of the input image&quot; as a potential alternative auxiliary task, in the hope that it may further boost the performances on the primary task or introduce novel constraints not well covered by image reconstruction. We experimented with five popular classification architectures on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and the empirical results indicated that our proposed auxiliary task generally improves the classification accuracy. More notably, the results showed that in certain cases our proposed auxiliary task may enhance the classifiers' resistance to adversarial attacks generated using the fast gradient sign method. </description>

      <title>Zero-shot learning approach to adaptive Cybersecurity using Explainable AI. (1%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14647</link>
      <description>  Cybersecurity is a domain where there is constant change in patterns of attack, and we need ways to make our Cybersecurity systems more adaptive to handle new attacks and categorize for appropriate action. We present a novel approach to handle the alarm flooding problem faced by Cybersecurity systems like security information and event management (SIEM) and intrusion detection (IDS). We apply a zero-shot learning method to machine learning (ML) by leveraging explanations for predictions of anomalies generated by a ML model. This approach has huge potential to auto detect alarm labels generated in SIEM and associate them with specific attack types. In this approach, without any prior knowledge of attack, we try to identify it, decipher the features that contribute to classification and try to bucketize the attack in a specific category - using explainable AI. Explanations give us measurable factors as to what features influence the prediction of a cyber-attack and to what degree. These explanations generated based on game-theory are used to allocate credit to specific features based on their influence on a specific prediction. Using this allocation of credit, we propose a novel zero-shot approach to categorize novel attacks into specific new classes based on feature influence. The resulting system demonstrated will get good at separating attack traffic from normal flow and auto-generate a label for attacks based on features that contribute to the attack. These auto-generated labels can be presented to SIEM analyst and are intuitive enough to figure out the nature of attack. We apply this approach to a network flow dataset and demonstrate results for specific attack types like ip sweep, denial of service, remote to local, etc.   Paper was presented at the first Conference on Deployable AI at IIT-Madras in June 2021. </description>

      <title>Adversarial Examples Make Strong Poisons. (98%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10807</link>
      <description>  The adversarial machine learning literature is largely partitioned into evasion attacks on testing data and poisoning attacks on training data. In this work, we show that adversarial examples, originally intended for attacking pre-trained models, are even more effective for data poisoning than recent methods designed specifically for poisoning. Our findings indicate that adversarial examples, when assigned the original label of their natural base image, cannot be used to train a classifier for natural images. Furthermore, when adversarial examples are assigned their adversarial class label, they are useful for training. This suggests that adversarial examples contain useful semantic content, just with the ``wrong'' labels (according to a network, but not a human). Our method, adversarial poisoning, is substantially more effective than existing poisoning methods for secure dataset release, and we release a poisoned version of ImageNet, ImageNet-P, to encourage research into the strength of this form of data obfuscation. </description>

      <title>Adversarial Attack on Graph Neural Networks as An Influence Maximization Problem. (95%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10785</link>
      <description>  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted increasing interests. With broad deployments of GNNs in real-world applications, there is an urgent need for understanding the robustness of GNNs under adversarial attacks, especially in realistic setups. In this work, we study the problem of attacking GNNs in a restricted and realistic setup, by perturbing the features of a small set of nodes, with no access to model parameters and model predictions. Our formal analysis draws a connection between this type of attacks and an influence maximization problem on the graph. This connection not only enhances our understanding on the problem of adversarial attack on GNNs, but also allows us to propose a group of effective and practical attack strategies. Our experiments verify that the proposed attack strategies significantly degrade the performance of three popular GNN models and outperform baseline adversarial attack strategies. </description>

      <title>Generative Model Adversarial Training for Deep Compressed Sensing. (8%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10696</link>
      <description>  Deep compressed sensing assumes the data has sparse representation in a latent space, i.e., it is intrinsically of low-dimension. The original data is assumed to be mapped from a low-dimensional space through a low-to-high-dimensional generator. In this work, we propound how to design such a low-to-high dimensional deep learning-based generator suiting for compressed sensing, while satisfying robustness to universal adversarial perturbations in the latent domain. We also justify why the noise is considered in the latent space. The work is also buttressed with theoretical analysis on the robustness of the trained generator to adversarial perturbations. Experiments on real-world datasets are provided to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed \emph{generative model adversarial training for deep compressed sensing.} </description>

      <title>Attack to Fool and Explain Deep Networks. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10606</link>
      <description>  Deep visual models are susceptible to adversarial perturbations to inputs. Although these signals are carefully crafted, they still appear noise-like patterns to humans. This observation has led to the argument that deep visual representation is misaligned with human perception. We counter-argue by providing evidence of human-meaningful patterns in adversarial perturbations. We first propose an attack that fools a network to confuse a whole category of objects (source class) with a target label. Our attack also limits the unintended fooling by samples from non-sources classes, thereby circumscribing human-defined semantic notions for network fooling. We show that the proposed attack not only leads to the emergence of regular geometric patterns in the perturbations, but also reveals insightful information about the decision boundaries of deep models. Exploring this phenomenon further, we alter the `adversarial' objective of our attack to use it as a tool to `explain' deep visual representation. We show that by careful channeling and projection of the perturbations computed by our method, we can visualize a model's understanding of human-defined semantic notions. Finally, we exploit the explanability properties of our perturbations to perform image generation, inpainting and interactive image manipulation by attacking adversarialy robust `classifiers'.In all, our major contribution is a novel pragmatic adversarial attack that is subsequently transformed into a tool to interpret the visual models. The article also makes secondary contributions in terms of establishing the utility of our attack beyond the adversarial objective with multiple interesting applications. </description>

      <title>A Stealthy and Robust Fingerprinting Scheme for Generative Models. (47%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11760</link>
      <description>  This paper presents a novel fingerprinting methodology for the Intellectual Property protection of generative models. Prior solutions for discriminative models usually adopt adversarial examples as the fingerprints, which give anomalous inference behaviors and prediction results. Hence, these methods are not stealthy and can be easily recognized by the adversary. Our approach leverages the invisible backdoor technique to overcome the above limitation. Specifically, we design verification samples, whose model outputs look normal but can trigger a backdoor classifier to make abnormal predictions. We propose a new backdoor embedding approach with Unique-Triplet Loss and fine-grained categorization to enhance the effectiveness of our fingerprints. Extensive evaluations show that this solution can outperform other strategies with higher robustness, uniqueness and stealthiness for various GAN models. </description>

      <title>Indicators of Attack Failure: Debugging and Improving Optimization of Adversarial Examples. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09947</link>
      <description>  Evaluating robustness of machine-learning models to adversarial examples is a challenging problem. Many defenses have been shown to provide a false sense of security by causing gradient-based attacks to fail, and they have been broken under more rigorous evaluations. Although guidelines and best practices have been suggested to improve current adversarial robustness evaluations, the lack of automatic testing and debugging tools makes it difficult to apply these recommendations in a systematic manner. In this work, we overcome these limitations by (i) defining a set of quantitative indicators which unveil common failures in the optimization of gradient-based attacks, and (ii) proposing specific mitigation strategies within a systematic evaluation protocol. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed indicators of failure can be used to visualize, debug and improve current adversarial robustness evaluations, providing a first concrete step towards automatizing and systematizing current adversarial robustness evaluations. Our open-source code is available at: https://github.com/pralab/IndicatorsOfAttackFailure. </description>

      <title>On the Connections between Counterfactual Explanations and Adversarial Examples. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09992</link>
      <description>  Counterfactual explanations and adversarial examples have emerged as critical research areas for addressing the explainability and robustness goals of machine learning (ML). While counterfactual explanations were developed with the goal of providing recourse to individuals adversely impacted by algorithmic decisions, adversarial examples were designed to expose the vulnerabilities of ML models. While prior research has hinted at the commonalities between these frameworks, there has been little to no work on systematically exploring the connections between the literature on counterfactual explanations and adversarial examples. In this work, we make one of the first attempts at formalizing the connections between counterfactual explanations and adversarial examples. More specifically, we theoretically analyze salient counterfactual explanation and adversarial example generation methods, and highlight the conditions under which they behave similarly. Our analysis demonstrates that several popular counterfactual explanation and adversarial example generation methods such as the ones proposed by Wachter et. al. and Carlini and Wagner (with mean squared error loss), and C-CHVAE and natural adversarial examples by Zhao et. al. are equivalent. We also bound the distance between counterfactual explanations and adversarial examples generated by Wachter et. al. and DeepFool methods for linear models. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings using extensive experimentation with synthetic and real world datasets. </description>

      <title>Residual Error: a New Performance Measure for Adversarial Robustness. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10212</link>
      <description>  Despite the significant advances in deep learning over the past decade, a major challenge that limits the wide-spread adoption of deep learning has been their fragility to adversarial attacks. This sensitivity to making erroneous predictions in the presence of adversarially perturbed data makes deep neural networks difficult to adopt for certain real-world, mission-critical applications. While much of the research focus has revolved around adversarial example creation and adversarial hardening, the area of performance measures for assessing adversarial robustness is not well explored. Motivated by this, this study presents the concept of residual error, a new performance measure for not only assessing the adversarial robustness of a deep neural network at the individual sample level, but also can be used to differentiate between adversarial and non-adversarial examples to facilitate for adversarial example detection. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid model for approximating the residual error in a tractable manner. Experimental results using the case of image classification demonstrates the effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed residual error metric for assessing several well-known deep neural network architectures. These results thus illustrate that the proposed measure could be a useful tool for not only assessing the robustness of deep neural networks used in mission-critical scenarios, but also in the design of adversarially robust models. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10151</link>
      <description>  The extreme fragility of deep neural networks when presented with tiny perturbations in their inputs was independently discovered by several research groups in 2013, but in spite of enormous effort these adversarial examples remained a baffling phenomenon with no clear explanation. In this paper we introduce a new conceptual framework (which we call the Dimpled Manifold Model) which provides a simple explanation for why adversarial examples exist, why their perturbations have such tiny norms, why these perturbations look like random noise, and why a network which was adversarially trained with incorrectly labeled images can still correctly classify test images. In the last part of the paper we describe the results of numerous experiments which strongly support this new model, and in particular our assertion that adversarial perturbations are roughly perpendicular to the low dimensional manifold which contains all the training examples. </description>

      <title>Light Lies: Optical Adversarial Attack. (92%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09908</link>
      <description>  A significant amount of work has been done on adversarial attacks that inject imperceptible noise to images to deteriorate the image classification performance of deep models. However, most of the existing studies consider attacks in the digital (pixel) domain where an image acquired by an image sensor with sampling and quantization has been recorded. This paper, for the first time, introduces an optical adversarial attack, which physically alters the light field information arriving at the image sensor so that the classification model yields misclassification. More specifically, we modulate the phase of the light in the Fourier domain using a spatial light modulator placed in the photographic system. The operative parameters of the modulator are obtained by gradient-based optimization to maximize cross-entropy and minimize distortions. We present experiments based on both simulation and a real hardware optical system, from which the feasibility of the proposed optical attack is demonstrated. It is also verified that the proposed attack is completely different from common optical-domain distortions such as spherical aberration, defocus, and astigmatism in terms of both perturbation patterns and classification results. </description>

      <title>BinarizedAttack: Structural Poisoning Attacks to Graph-based Anomaly Detection. (82%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09989</link>
      <description>  Graph-based Anomaly Detection (GAD) is becoming prevalent due to the powerful representation abilities of graphs as well as recent advances in graph mining techniques. These GAD tools, however, expose a new attacking surface, ironically due to their unique advantage of being able to exploit the relations among data. That is, attackers now can manipulate those relations (i.e., the structure of the graph) to allow some target nodes to evade detection. In this paper, we exploit this vulnerability by designing a new type of targeted structural poisoning attacks to a representative regression-based GAD system termed OddBall. Specially, we formulate the attack against OddBall as a bi-level optimization problem, where the key technical challenge is to efficiently solve the problem in a discrete domain. We propose a novel attack method termed BinarizedAttack based on gradient descent. Comparing to prior arts, BinarizedAttack can better use the gradient information, making it particularly suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, we investigate the attack transferability of BinarizedAttack by employing it to attack other representation-learning-based GAD systems. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinarizedAttack is very effective in enabling target nodes to evade graph-based anomaly detection tools with limited attackers' budget, and in the black-box transfer attack setting, BinarizedAttack is also tested effective and in particular, can significantly change the node embeddings learned by the GAD systems. Our research thus opens the door to studying a new type of attack against security analytic tools that rely on graph data. </description>

      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10252</link>
      <description>  A common observation regarding adversarial attacks is that they mostly give rise to false activation at the penultimate layer to fool the classifier. Assuming that these activation values correspond to certain features of the input, the objective becomes choosing the features that are most useful for classification. Hence, we propose a novel approach to identify the important features by employing counter-adversarial attacks, which highlights the consistency at the penultimate layer with respect to perturbations on input samples. First, we empirically show that there exist a subset of features, classification based in which bridge the gap between the clean and robust accuracy. Second, we propose a simple yet efficient mechanism to identify those features by searching the neighborhood of input sample. We then select features by observing the consistency of the activation values at the penultimate layer. </description>

      <title>Group-Structured Adversarial Training. (68%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10324</link>
      <description>  Robust training methods against perturbations to the input data have received great attention in the machine learning literature. A standard approach in this direction is adversarial training which learns a model using adversarially-perturbed training samples. However, adversarial training performs suboptimally against perturbations structured across samples such as universal and group-sparse shifts that are commonly present in biological data such as gene expression levels of different tissues. In this work, we seek to close this optimality gap and introduce Group-Structured Adversarial Training (GSAT) which learns a model robust to perturbations structured across samples. We formulate GSAT as a non-convex concave minimax optimization problem which minimizes a group-structured optimal transport cost. Specifically, we focus on the applications of GSAT for group-sparse and rank-constrained perturbations modeled using group and nuclear norm penalties. In order to solve GSAT's non-smooth optimization problem in those cases, we propose a new minimax optimization algorithm called GDADMM by combining Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We present several applications of the GSAT framework to gain robustness against structured perturbations for image recognition and computational biology datasets. </description>

      <title>Evaluating the Robustness of Trigger Set-Based Watermarks Embedded in Deep Neural Networks. (45%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10147</link>
      <description>  Trigger set-based watermarking schemes have gained emerging attention as they provide a means to prove ownership for deep neural network model owners. In this paper, we argue that state-of-the-art trigger set-based watermarking algorithms do not achieve their designed goal of proving ownership. We posit that this impaired capability stems from two common experimental flaws that the existing research practice has committed when evaluating the robustness of watermarking algorithms: (1) incomplete adversarial evaluation and (2) overlooked adaptive attacks.   We conduct a comprehensive adversarial evaluation of 10 representative watermarking schemes against six of the existing attacks and demonstrate that each of these watermarking schemes lacks robustness against at least two attacks. We also propose novel adaptive attacks that harness the adversary's knowledge of the underlying watermarking algorithm of a target model. We demonstrate that the proposed attacks effectively break all of the 10 watermarking schemes, consequently allowing adversaries to obscure the ownership of any watermarked model. We encourage follow-up studies to consider our guidelines when evaluating the robustness of their watermarking schemes via conducting comprehensive adversarial evaluation that include our adaptive attacks to demonstrate a meaningful upper bound of watermark robustness. </description>

      <description>  Collecting training data from untrusted sources exposes machine learning services to poisoning adversaries, who maliciously manipulate training data to degrade the model accuracy. When trained on offline datasets, poisoning adversaries have to inject the poisoned data in advance before training, and the order of feeding these poisoned batches into the model is stochastic. In contrast, practical systems are more usually trained/fine-tuned on sequentially captured real-time data, in which case poisoning adversaries could dynamically poison each data batch according to the current model state. In this paper, we focus on the real-time settings and propose a new attacking strategy, which affiliates an accumulative phase with poisoning attacks to secretly (i.e., without affecting accuracy) magnify the destructive effect of a (poisoned) trigger batch. By mimicking online learning and federated learning on CIFAR-10, we show that the model accuracy will significantly drop by a single update step on the trigger batch after the accumulative phase. Our work validates that a well-designed but straightforward attacking strategy can dramatically amplify the poisoning effects, with no need to explore complex techniques. </description>

      <title>Federated Robustness Propagation: Sharing Adversarial Robustness in Federated Learning. (5%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10196</link>
      <description>  Federated learning (FL) emerges as a popular distributed learning schema that learns a model from a set of participating users without requiring raw data to be shared. One major challenge of FL comes from heterogeneity in users, which may have distributionally different (or non-iid) data and varying computation resources. Just like in centralized learning, FL users also desire model robustness against malicious attackers at test time. Whereas adversarial training (AT) provides a sound solution for centralized learning, extending its usage for FL users has imposed significant challenges, as many users may have very limited training data as well as tight computational budgets, to afford the data-hungry and costly AT. In this paper, we study a novel learning setting that propagates adversarial robustness from high-resource users that can afford AT, to those low-resource users that cannot afford it, during the FL process. We show that existing FL techniques cannot effectively propagate adversarial robustness among non-iid users, and propose a simple yet effective propagation approach that transfers robustness through carefully designed batch-normalization statistics. We demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments. Especially, the proposed method is shown to grant FL remarkable robustness even when only a small portion of users afford AT during learning. Codes will be published upon acceptance. </description>

      <title>Analyzing Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks in Pixel Space: a Semantic Perspective. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09872</link>
      <description>  The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, which are crafted maliciously by modifying the inputs with imperceptible perturbations to misled the network produce incorrect outputs, reveals the lack of robustness and poses security concerns. Previous works study the adversarial robustness of image classifiers on image level and use all the pixel information in an image indiscriminately, lacking of exploration of regions with different semantic meanings in the pixel space of an image. In this work, we fill this gap and explore the pixel space of the adversarial image by proposing an algorithm to looking for possible perturbations pixel by pixel in different regions of the segmented image. The extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet verify that searching for the modified pixel in only some pixels of an image can successfully launch the one-pixel adversarial attacks without requiring all the pixels of the entire image, and there exist multiple vulnerable points scattered in different regions of an image. We also demonstrate that the adversarial robustness of different regions on the image varies with the amount of semantic information contained. </description>

      <title>Bad Characters: Imperceptible NLP Attacks. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09898</link>
      <description>  Several years of research have shown that machine-learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples, both in theory and in practice. Until now, such attacks have primarily targeted visual models, exploiting the gap between human and machine perception. Although text-based models have also been attacked with adversarial examples, such attacks struggled to preserve semantic meaning and indistinguishability. In this paper, we explore a large class of adversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a black-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to inputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web search engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection -- representing one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion -- an attacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and with three injections most models can be functionally broken. Our attacks work against currently-deployed commercial systems, including those produced by Microsoft and Google, in addition to open source models published by Facebook and IBM. This novel series of attacks presents a significant threat to many language processing systems: an attacker can affect systems in a targeted manner without any assumptions about the underlying model. We conclude that text-based NLP systems require careful input sanitization, just like conventional applications, and that given such systems are now being deployed rapidly at scale, the urgent attention of architects and operators is required. </description>

      <title>Adversarial Visual Robustness by Causal Intervention. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09534</link>
      <description>  Adversarial training is the de facto most promising defense against adversarial examples. Yet, its passive nature inevitably prevents it from being immune to unknown attackers. To achieve a proactive defense, we need a more fundamental understanding of adversarial examples, beyond the popular bounded threat model. In this paper, we provide a causal viewpoint of adversarial vulnerability: the cause is the confounder ubiquitously existing in learning, where attackers are precisely exploiting the confounding effect. Therefore, a fundamental solution for adversarial robustness is causal intervention. As the confounder is unobserved in general, we propose to use the instrumental variable that achieves intervention without the need for confounder observation. We term our robust training method as Causal intervention by instrumental Variable (CiiV). It has a differentiable retinotopic sampling layer and a consistency loss, which is stable and guaranteed not to suffer from gradient obfuscation. Extensive experiments on a wide spectrum of attackers and settings applied in MNIST, CIFAR-10, and mini-ImageNet datasets empirically demonstrate that CiiV is robust to adaptive attacks. </description>

      <title>DeepInsight: Interpretability Assisting Detection of Adversarial Samples on Graphs. (99%)</title>
      <link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09501</link>
      <description>  With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, a series of machine learning algorithms, e.g., graph neural networks, have been proposed to facilitate network analysis or graph data mining. Unfortunately, recent studies indicate that such advanced methods may suffer from adversarial attacks, i.e., they may lose effectiveness when only a small fraction of links are purposely changed. However, little is known what's the difference between adversarial nodes and clean nodes, and what's the preference of each attack method, in terms of network structure. In this paper, we theoretically investigate three well-known adversarial attack methods, i.e., Nettack, Meta Attack, and GradArgmax, and find that different attack methods have their specific attack preferences on changing network structure. Such attack patterns are further validated by the experimental results on real-world networks, i.e., generally the top 4 most important network attributes on detecting adversarial samples are sufficient to explain the preference of each attack method. Based on these findings, we further utilize the network attributes to design machine learning models for adversarial sample detection and attack method recognition, achieving the outstanding performance. </description>
